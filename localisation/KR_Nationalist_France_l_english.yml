### Ideas ###
NFA_anti_communard:0 "Anti-Communard"
NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"
NFA_french_in_exile:0 "France in Exile"

NFA_political_unrest_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of our military government, discontent is rising in the Fourth Republic's population. Prime Minister Maurice Janin's recent political blunders has forced Marshall Petain to look for a replacement. However, onlookers are raising the concern that simply changing the Prime Minister won't be enough to appease the population. Many believe this unrest is a signal for the future of France."

### Focuses ###
NFA_industrial_revival:0 "Industrial Expansion"
NFA_industrial_revival_desc:0 "Our industry here in Africa is far behind the one the communards have on the mainland. If we want to defeat them we'll have to strengthen our industry significantly."
NFA_sahara_census:0 "Begin the Saharan Census and Inventory"
NFA_sahara_census_desc:0 "The French Government-in-Exile has had a tough economic situation, leading to several outlandish projects in order to gain more funds. Some bright young mind in a government agency has come up with an idea to make a census and inventory of the Sahara region. We should send out government officials and expeditions to survey the region."
NFA_sahara_census_tooltip:0 "The Algeria-Central Africa Census and Inventory will begin... \n"
NFA_inventory_progress:0 "The Algeria-Central Africa Inventory is complete."
NFA_develop_ALG:0 "Routes Départementales"
NFA_develop_ALG_desc:0 "Before thinking of enhancing our industrial output, we have to improve (and in some cases, create from scratch) the infrastructure of the Algerian departments. Unfortunately, they're not nearly as developed as we hoped they would be."
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG:0 "Dirigisme"
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG_desc:0 "Before our defeat against the red scum, Algeria was the most developed colony in our whole empire – but it was still a colony, one with low industrial capacity. The glaring lack of financial input has not made the situation better. We should sponsor state-run companies to alleviate this problem."
NFA_military_factories_ALG:0 "Algerian War Industry"
NFA_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "To reconquer our homeland we need to produce more weapons than the traitors against us. Funding new factories should help us reduce the difference between us and them."
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG:0 "Expand the Metal Industry"
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "The newly created mines and factories will allow us to build a grand metal industry designed to supply our army."
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway:0 "The Dakar to Algiers Airway"
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway_desc:0 "The Dakar to Algiers Airways was the brain child of Felix Amiot and was designed to kick start the economy in the south of the nation. The competition with German and South African businesses had been a problem for the struggling French businesses and Amiot wanted to help. He was hoping that a new airline could bring more business to North Africa."
NFA_expand_airway:0 "Expand the Airway"
NFA_expand_airway_desc:0 "The success of the DAA has led to Amiot wanting to expand it throughout Africa. Amiot wishes to expand in every direction, but we run the risk of the DAA stretching itself too thin. Should we do it anyway?"
NFA_improve_maritime_links:0 "Improve Maritime Links"
NFA_improve_maritime_links_desc:0 "The cohesion between our Algerian industry and West African holdings greatly relies on the quality of the infrastructure connecting the two parts. By expanding and improving the maritime links between them we can hope for a more efficient industrial base."
NFA_develop_mines:0 "Open New Mines"
NFA_develop_mines_desc:0 "The first step in the exploitation of our West African holdings has proven successful. We should increase the number of mines and start building some basic metal refineries to support further development."
NFA_colonial_resources:0 "Colonial Exploitation"
NFA_colonial_resources_desc:0 "If we want to fuel our industry we need resources. Thankfully, our West African holdings are full of iron, aluminium, and other metals! If we dig new mines and make people work for us (willingly or not) we could improve our finances and reduce our industry's reliance on foreign supplies!"
NFA_sahara:0 "Exploit the Saharan Oil"
NFA_sahara_desc:0 "The Sahara is big and empty, but perhaps not as empty as we once thought? Plenty of Berber tribes live deep inside these territories where our reach does not fully extend. With traces of oil being found in the territory, the Sahara could be the solution to many of our problems if we exploit it!"
NFA_algerie_refinery:0 "Algerian Refineries"
NFA_algerie_refinery_desc:0 "The Saharan oil covers most of our needs but we could greatly increase our production with the development of refineries on the Mediterranean Coast."
NFA_extra_research_slot:0 "New Research Facilities"
NFA_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "Promising young minds are popping up everywhere. We need to supply them with facilities to conduct their research. Advances in technology can give us the edge we need to reconquer our homeland."
NFA_Darlan_Focus:0 "The Darlan Plan"
NFA_Darlan_Focus_desc:0 "The General Strategy of the French State will follow the advice of Admiral Darlan, focusing on defending our holdings from possible threats, instead of recklessly risking our forces on enemy lands."
NFA_fortification_focus:0 "Standardisation of the Fortifications"
NFA_fortification_focus_desc:0 "It is imperative that was are not surprised by enemy landings. If we want to defend our holdings better, it would be wise to standardise fortification designs to reduce construction times. The quicker we have our fortifications up, the better."
NFA_mediteranean_forts:0 "Protecting the Coastline"
NFA_mediteranean_forts_desc:0 "The most important task of our industry is to heavily fortify the Mediterranean coast so as to create a fortress safe from the Communards and their lackeys!"
NFA_protect_the_air:0 "Air Protection"
NFA_protect_the_air_desc:0 "Our coastal fortifications will be worthless if the sky is controlled by our enemies, our forces harassed by their aerial attacks and our industries reduced to shambles."
NFA_radar_effort:0 "Develop Radar Technology"
NFA_radar_effort_desc:0 "The latest technology in detection is the so called RADAR. If we set up radars along the African North coast we could detect any invasion across the Mediterranean while it was still in the planning phase!"
NFA_aviation_home_defense:0 "Aviation : Home Defence Focus"
NFA_aviation_home_defense_desc:0 "Air warfare in desert areas is quite different from air warfare on the European continent. We must take every detail into consideration when designing our air force."
NFA_cas_effort:0 "CAS Effort"
NFA_cas_effort_desc:0 "With no place to hide in the open plains of North Africa, infantry and even armour units are very exposed to aerial attacks. Close air supports with sow and reap death in any enemy formation!"
NFA_navy_expansion:0 "Expansion of the French Navy"
NFA_navy_expansion_desc:0 "We must not let our enemies come close to our coasts and threaten our haven : the French Navy must be enlarged and our hold on the sea secured!"
NFA_navy_expansion_tooltip:0 "This Focus will unlock events freely giving new ships. \n"
NFA_dockyard_focus:0 "Expansion of the Dakar Dockyards"
NFA_dockyard_focus_desc:0 "We needed to build from scratch naval dockyards following the loss of France. Dakar was chosen to host our submarine bases and we feel it needs to be enlarged so that we can compete with our enemies in the Mediterranean."
NFA_naval_doctrine:0 "Study New Tactics"
NFA_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Darlan has sent some of his brightest officers abroad, to Japan and Canada, to study the latest expertise on naval warfare."
NFA_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroyer Focus"
NFA_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "While great battleships might have been preferable, it is sadly unrealistic to attempt to construct these with our current industrial capacity. Modern destroyers are better suited to our needs."
NFA_light_cruiser_focus:0 "Light Cruiser Focus"
NFA_light_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Light Cruisers should make up the core of our modern, specialised fleet. They are not expensive to construct but can, despite their weight, deliver heavy damage to enemy ships and planes alike."
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus:0 "Heavy Cruiser Focus"
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are key ships in any potent fleet meant to dominate an ocean. If we can focus our war industry well enough we should be able to produce a large enough number of these deadly vessels to control our home seas."
NFA_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship focus"
NFA_battleship_focus_desc:0 "To defeat our enemies we will have to destroy them in decisive fights. What better weapons than battleships to win this fight?"
NFA_DeGaulle_focus:0 "De Gaulle Plan"
NFA_DeGaulle_focus_desc:0 "The Military High-Command will follow the recommendations of Général de Gaulle, focusing on building our military forces to retake our homeland."
NFA_southern_conscription:0 "Southern Conscription"
NFA_southern_conscription_desc:0 "Nationalist France had been struggling with manpower. The reputation of the French military had been tarnished by its failure in the Weltkrieg and volunteering was at an all time low. Fiercely national Frenchman could not be the only source of manpower and other sources of manpower were needed. The government is looking to the people in the south of the country."
NFA_native_conscription:0 "Native Conscription"
NFA_native_conscription_desc:0 "The easiest way to increase the number of available men is to conscript the local men into our army and make them fight for us. It was a solution that the High-Command was reluctant to implement because of the risk of sedition from these new units."
NFA_native_conscription_tooltip:0 "You will gain 2 Cavalry Divisions in Constantine and 4 Infantry Divisions in French Sudan. \n"
NFA_continue_native_conscription:0 "Continue the Native Conscription"
NFA_continue_native_conscription_desc:0 "While recruitment from the Northern provinces was met with resistance from the parliament, we still do not have enough men. We could extend conscription to the south, not only relying on the Arabs but also the Sub-Saharan Africans. It should grant us sorely needed manpower, but it will require a lot of political effort to pull through."
NFA_native_conscription2_tooltip:0 "You will gain 1 Cavalry Division in Constantine and 5 Infantry Divisions in French Sudan. \n"
NFA_legionary_campaign:0 "Strengthen the Légion Étrangère"
NFA_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "To increase our armed forces we could increase the size of the Légion Étrangère. Hosting the valorous anti-syndicalist fighters from around the world our Army could become the bane of the Red Hydra!"
NFA_legionary_campaign_tooltip:0 "You will gain 3 Infantry Divisions in Algiers. \n"
NFA_continue_legionary_campaign:0 "Expand the Recruitment Campaign"
NFA_continue_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "Irish, American, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese men will be encouraged in extensive, foreign propaganda campaigns to join our brave, anti-syndicalist Forces!"
NFA_legionary_campaign2_tooltip:0 "You will gain 3 Infantry Divisions in Algiers. \n"
NFA_aviation_invasion:0 "Aviation : Invasion Focus"
NFA_aviation_invasion_desc:0 "Invading a nation across the sea will require us to rely on long distance precision bombers, able to hit supply lines and reserves before they reach the ports."
NFA_aviation_doctrine:0 "New Generation of Officers"
NFA_aviation_doctrine_desc:0 "The so called Young Guards, able and blooming young men of France, have many revolutionary ideas for how to conduct warfare."
NFA_naval_bomber_focus:0 "Control the Sea From Above"
NFA_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "While we may be unable to afford constructing a fleet able to rival that of our enemies, we can design naval bombers able to control the Mediterranean for long enough to initiate a landing in our home lands."
NFA_paratrooper_focus:0 "Found the Troupes Aéroportées"
NFA_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "The Young Guards have presented us with a new, daring idea. Lightly supported infantry could be dropped from planes behind enemy lines and cut off tactically important locations."
NFA_invasion_navy:0 "An Invasion Navy"
NFA_invasion_navy_desc:0 "Our navy is badly outdated and could, at best, prevent the Reds from landing in North Africa. We need to control the sea if we wish to perform a successful invasion of southern France."
NFA_naval_invasion_focus:0 "The Vaisseaux de la Libération"
NFA_naval_invasion_focus_desc:0 "We cannot be satisfied with simply a navy able to do battle. We also need a large convoy fleet, able to feed our armies once we start liberating southern France."
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle:0 "Battleship Focus"
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle_desc:0 "Battleships may be expensive, but no one can deny the important role they play in naval warfare, and in amphibious landings. Their large guns can hammer any local resistance to dust before the marines even reach the beach!"
NFA_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
NFA_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines are cheap and work excellently to both escort and intercept convoy lanes."
NFA_carrier_effort:0 "Carrier Effort"
NFA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Carriers are expensive and massive naval projects to undertake... But should we manage to construct a few and protect them with screens, our navy will go from an outdated relic of the past to one of the most feared ones the world knows."

NFA_restore_constitution:0 "Restore the Suspended Constitution"
NFA_restore_constitution_desc:0 "The third republic ended much like the previous one, with a defeat to the Germans. Following the Communard uprising and the escape to Africa, the constitution was put in suspension by Joffre and later Petain. Perhaps it's time to end the military rule and reform to our true ideals of French democracy?"
NFA_restore_constitution_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore a democratic 4th Republic.§! \n"
NFA_monarchy:0 "Restore the Kingdom of France"
NFA_monarchy_desc:0 "It is a known fact that France has suffered extensively under disjointed governments. A strong character could act as a permanent head of state and offer stability to our nation, in particular if we maintain a strong parliament next to the King. Although it might be tempting to dream of the glory days of The Sun King and restore French monarchy to its fullest."
NFA_monarchy_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore a Monarchy in National France headed by the house of d'Orléans.§! \n"
NFA_empire:0 "Restore the French Empire"
NFA_empire_desc:0 "Kings and democratically elected governments have both failed France. During the reign of Napoleon Europe was dominated by the proud French people, although even if he is installed we need to determine whether power should lie with the Emperor or with the parliament. Either way, Vive l'Empereur!"
NFA_empire_tooltip:0 "§RYou will restore an Empire in National France headed by Napoléon IV.§! \n"
NFA_Petain_president:0 "Continuation of the Petain Presidency"
NFA_Petain_president_desc:0 "The announcement of the democratisation of the regime has struck many people by surprise. Although Maréchal Pétain is at the origin of the reform, he is normally forced to abdicate his role of President. Then again he could easily retain his position by simply pulling a few strings..."
NFA_petain_pres_tooltip:0 "§RPétain will stay president until his potential resignation or death.§! \n"
NFA_new_president:0 "Elect a New President"
NFA_new_president_desc:0 "The democratisation of the Fourth Republic requires the Maréchal to leave the office and elect another man, one who was not at the head of the junta that ruled before."
NFA_new_president_tooltip:0 "§RA new president will be elected during the next elections.§! \n"
NFA_Judiciary_reform:0 "Equality Before the Law"
NFA_Judiciary_reform_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We could use this occasion to make all inhabitants of the Republic equal before the law, at the cost of course of alienating the Pieds Noirs."
NFA_judiciary_frenchmen:0 "Colonial Courts"
NFA_judiciary_frenchmen_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We should reaffirm that French and colonised are not equal before the law by confirming the existence of colonial courts for the locals."
NFA_extended_suffrage:0 "Extended Suffrage"
NFA_extended_suffrage_desc:0 "The upcoming elections require us to delimit who will be able to vote. Traditionally the colonised could not vote, leaving the Algerian assembly dominated by the Pied-Noirs minority. We could begin to open the suffrage to good servants and those who serve in the military, to improve our relations with the locals."
NFA_limited_suffrage:0 "Pieds-Noirs Suffrage"
NFA_limited_suffrage_desc:0 "Some of the locals have asked to vote in the upcoming elections as citizens of the French Republic. We need to reaffirm that only French people can vote, and not the inferior peoples of the colonies!"
NFA_Constitutionalism:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
NFA_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "The reestablishment of our head of state has allowed the French people to be more united but our leader knows that he can't rule alone, and most of the old Constitution will be used for the new regime."
NFA_constit_mon_tooltip:0 "§RThe new rule shall be constitutional!§! \n"
NFA_Absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
NFA_Absolutism_desc:0 "The Republic has failed France and we need a strong hand to rule our people! By putting our faith in our head of state and God we are sure retake our lost home from the Reds!"
NFA_absolutism_tooltip:0 "§RA strong central power is needed!§! \n"
NFA_puppet_chamber:0 "Anti-Parlementarisme"
NFA_puppet_chamber_desc:0 "The new regime could use the old distrust between the French people and the Assembly to justify the new methods to rule France."
NFA_monarch_prestige:0 "Idealised Sovereign"
NFA_monarch_prestige_desc:0 "Our monarch is a great, liberal and strong sovereign. At least that's what the people should be thinking after we have 'convinced' them."
NFA_strenghthened_governement:0 "Reinforced Government"
NFA_strenghthened_governement_desc:0 "The government is now stronger and can prepare the people for the upcoming war."

NFA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks will prove themselves to be the most important vehicle of any war, or so De Gaulle claims. It's time we invest in them."
NFA_troupes_de_marine:0 "The Troupes de Marine"
NFA_troupes_de_marine_desc:0 "Key figures in the French military have recently proposed an idea on how to reclaim mainland France. The Troupes de Marine, until now part of the Troupes Coloniales, would become an entirely separate branch of the French military. The marines would receive funding, and be able to better train new marine forces for any future invasion of France itself."
NFA_mountain_elites:0 "Legacy of the Chasseurs Alpins"

NFA_support_carlists:0 "Support the Carlists"
NFA_support_carlists_desc:0 "Spain is thrown into Civil War. Instead of supporting the decadent Kingdom of Spain we could support the true pretenders to the throne, our Catholic brothers, the Carlists."

NFA_alliance_catholic:0 "Join the Mediterranean Bloc"

### Events ###
nfa.1.t:0 "The situation of National France in 1936"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In the aftermath of the French Communal Revolution, the whole apparatus of state and French military, sheltered in Marseille, quickly embarked with the French Navy to Algiers, fleeing the newly created Commune of France. After the peace negotiations with Germany, the French refugee politicians decided to start from scratch again, proclaiming the French Fourth Republic, in exile in Africa but claiming the French motherland. Soon, it was obvious that the parliamentarian regime was outdated, as the exiled leading politicians were mainly nationalists and authoritarian : the military subsequently seized the executive powers, under the leadership of popular marshal Ferdinand Foch. After his death in 1929, the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, took his place, helped by his protégé, admiral François Darlan. Although the military regime of the French Republic in exile, still allied with the British monarchy in exile, has coalesced and stabilised, it still faces numerous threats.
