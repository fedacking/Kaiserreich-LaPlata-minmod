### Events ###
legcities.1.t:0 "The Corruption of Officials"
legcities.1.d:0 "The Legation Cities have always lawless, but the recent downturn in the global economy has made matters worse. Smuggling into A.O.G. territory has increased, and the Legation Council has been unable to pay its civil servants for several months now. Many constables and customs officials are beginning to turn to the underworld for new sources of income. We have always needed to work with the secret criminal fraternities, but now it seems they are taking on more power than our government..."
legcities.1.a:0 "Do nothing"
legcities.1.b:0 "Grant the Crime Bosses positions on the Council"
legcities.1.c:0 "Increase tariff duties to pay the wages of our bureaucrats."
legcities.1.e:0 "Pour resources into defence, and clean up the corruption!"

legcities.2.t:0 "The Night of the Monkey's Head"
legcities.2.d:0 "'Big Ears' Du has taken advantage of the economic difficulties in Shanghai and the other Legation Ports to become the undisputed master of the extensive criminal networks criss-crossing the autonomous cities. However, total political control has thus far escaped him - he consults his soothsayer to see what the omens have in store for him..."
legcities.2.a:0 "You must donate money to the Legation Council and other good causes"
legcities.2.b:0 "It is time to organise a massacre of all who oppose you!"
legcities.2.c:0 "The Hong-Kong Constabulary are about to put an end to your operations!"

legcities.3.t:0 "Criminal Activities!"
legcities.3.d:0 "AlgOstAsien-Sicherheitsamt has uncovered a frightening amount of criminal activity among the Chinese population, which is threatening the financial solvency of the Company. This is seeming to spill over from the Legation Cities, which have recently developed into hives of criminality and centres of organisation for unsavoury associations of all types."
legcities.3.a:0 "Tighten up border controls and break-up the criminal networks in our zone"
legcities.3.b:0 "Do nothing - we cannot spare the money."
legcities.3.c:0 "Dissolve the autonomy statutes of the Legation Cities!"

legcities.4.t:0 "AlgOstAsien GmbH is weak"
legcities.4.d:0 "Our activities in the South China have been strongly resisted by the agents of AlgOstAsien GmbH. However, we have one more possible trick to play - in the ports, we have frequently worked through transport and dockers unions. If we could encourage the workers in AlgOstAsien's factories to organise in a similar way, we could gain a firm foothold beyond the Legation Cities..."
legcities.4.a:0 "No, we shall remain in the ports."
legcities.4.b:0 "A fine idea!"

legcities.5.t:0 "Expansion along the Chinese Coast?"
legcities.5.d:0 "After much difficult struggle and organisation, our agents have gained an unparalleled position in Southern China. Through our control of political, labour and criminal organisations outside the Legation Cities, it could be possible to extend the Charter of Autonomy and engineer a transfer of control over much territory from AlgOstAsien to the Legation Council..."
legcities.5.a:0 "'Encourage' the South Chinese Coast to join our Federation!"
legcities.5.b:0 "We are happy with our invisible networks of influence".

legcities.6.t:0 "The South China Coast Breaks Away!"
legcities.6.d:0 "Criminals, corrupt officials and bought company representatives all over South China have decided to publicly throw in their lot with the underworld bosses dominating the Legation Cities! They are arguing for an end to AlgOstAsien authority over Coastal China, and the extension of the Charter of Legation Autonomy to their territories!"
legcities.6.a:0 "We cannot oppose them"
legcities.6.b:0 "Fight these criminals!"

legcities.7.t:0 "Fall of the Legation Cities"
legcities.7.d:0 "The armed forces of the AOG have delivered our rag-tag collections of armed tugs crushing defeat. We can either offer our surrender to AOG now, while our armed forces still exist and hope for leniency or continue with our resistance and hope for a miracle..."
legcities.7.a:0 "Surrender now"
legcities.7.b:0 "Fight till the end!"

legcities.8.t:0 "Fall of the Legation Cities"
legcities.8.d:0 "After a bloody war against the criminals based in the Legation Cities, the armed forces of the AOG are victorious! The humiliated leadership of the Legation Cities offered us their unconditional surrender in hopes for our leniency. What shall we do with the Legation Cities?"
legcities.8.a:0 "Permanent annexation will solve this!"
legcities.8.b:0 "That will suffice!"

legcities.9.t:0 "Tokyo conference"
legcities.9.d:0 "The surprising victory over the Legation Cities and their elimination by the AOG means that the German Empire gains new sources of profits. Due to the large foreign investment and capital present, the Legation Cities were under collective protection so all regional powers should decide their fate!"
legcities.9.a:0 "Let's call a conference"
legcities.9.b:0 "Forget about it!"

legcities.10.t:0 "Tokyo conference"
legcities.10.d:0 "The surprising victory over the Legation Cities and their elimination by the AOG means that the German Empire gains new sources of profits. Due to the large foreign investment and capital present, the Legation Cities were under collective protection so all regional powers should decide their fate!"
legcities.10.a:0 "Join the conference"
legcities.10.b:0 "Forget about it!"

legcities.11.d:0 "The surprising victory over the Legation Cities and their elimination by the AOG means that the German Empire gains new sources of profits.

legcities.11.a:0 "Join the conference"

legcities.12.a:0 "Join the conference"
legcities.12.b:0 "Forget about it!"

legcities.13.t:0 "Tokyo conference"
legcities.13.d:0 "The surprising victory over the Legation Cities and their elimination by the AOG means that the German Empire gains new sources of profits. Due to the large foreign investment and capital present, the Legation Cities were under collective protection so all regional powers should decide their fate!"
legcities.13.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

legcities.14.t:0 "Tokyo conference cancelled"
legcities.14.d:0 "Our attempt to call up an international conference regarding the status of the Legation Cities was a failure. Unfortunately, some important protectors of the Legation Cities decided to stay out of the conference."
legcities.14.a:0 "Oh no!"

legcities.15.t:0 "Results of the Tokyo Conference"
legcities.15.d:0 "The conference was a complete success! All participants agreed, that in order to protect valuable international investments in Chinese ports, the Legation Cities must re-emerge as an independent international subject. Now, the A.O.G. has to free the Legation Cities!"
legcities.15.a:0 "Another success of our diplomacy!"

legcities.16.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.16.d:0 "Although the conference itself was a success, the result is harsh. Delegates agreed with the AOG's opinion that its occupation of Chinese ports will provide the best protection of foreign investments, which means that the Legation Cities will remain occupied by the AOG."
legcities.16.a:0 "Drat!"

legcities.17.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.17.d:0 "All major participants of the Tokyo conference have reached an agreement about the future status of the Legation cities. They will be independent once more, under international supervision in order to protect valuable investments. This decision leaves us with no other option than to comply with the results of the conference."
legcities.17.a:0 "Drat!"

legcities.18.t:0 "Rebirth of Legation Cities"
legcities.18.d:0 "We are free once more!"
legcities.18.a:0 "Hurrah!"

legcities.19.t:0 "A Common Enemy."
legcities.19.d:0 "Now when we are at war with Algostasien we need to do everything to survive, our enemy is not only at war with us, but also with the newly born Republic of China! Shall we reach out to the republicans? Together we might be able to fully defeat German presence in China!"
legcities.19.a:0 "We are stronger together, make a move!"
legcities.19.b:0 "It will only make things worse."

legcities.20.t:0 "A Common Enemy"
legcities.20.d:0 "Legation Cities have managed to send a request to our newly formed cabinet, asking us to form an alliance with them, an alliance to easier crush the German puppet! Shall we accept, or are we stronger on ourselves?"
legcities.20.a:0 "We are in a need of allies, Accept!"
legcities.20.b:0 "They will only cause trouble."

legcities.21.t:0 "The Republicans Accepted"
legcities.21.d:0 "We are not alone anymore, together we can fight off these scum, and look forward to a more brighter future."
legcities.21.a:0 "Long Live Free China!""

legcities.22.t:0 "Profits from Legation cities"
legcities.22.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under a joint control of world powers owning interests in China. The independence of these consortium of cities was guaranteed by the major local and international powers, such as the Qing Empire, AlgOstAsien GmbH, Japan, Australia, Canada, United States and Germany. Foreign investments and Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AlgOstAsien and Qing territories. Despite ongoing economic crisis, our investment in Legation cities are still bringing us grand profit."
legcities.22.a:0 "Let the money flow..."

legcities.28.t:0 "Seize foreign investments?"
legcities.28.d:0 "Our armed forces have seized control over the rich and industrialised Legation cities with its large foreign investments. Several important members of the armed forces and few radical politicians suggest to seize control over foreign investments, basically to expropriate them, thus improve our fiscal conditions and deny our potential enemies additional profit. However, such act would definitively anger many important world powers, which will not look kindly to us denying them their rightful profits..."
legcities.28.a:0 "Seize foreign investments!"
legcities.28.b:0 "Seize investments and compensate foreign powers!"
legcities.28.c:0 "This is too risky..."

legcities.29.t:0 "Profits from Legation cities no longer available"
legcities.29.d:0 "Terrible news. Our investments in the Legation cities have been expropriated by the occupying forces, cutting out one source of income for our homeland. How shall we react to this despicable act?"
