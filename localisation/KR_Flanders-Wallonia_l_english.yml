### Events ###
bel.1.t:0 "Disaster of the 17th of February '36"
bel.1.d:0 "During the celebrations for Coronation day the King gave a Speech standing on the balcony of the Royal Palace in Brussels. Thousands of citizens of the capital were attending and awaiting the the royal address. Exactly on the stroke of 12 the King entered the balcony and was about to begin his speech when from the midst of the crowd a chant began. The singing began to spread as wildfire and soon the Brabançonne could be heard in all parts of Brussels. The police force couldn't handle the number of protesters and retreated into the Palace."
bel.1.a:0 "Try to calm the protesters with small concessions"
bel.1.b:0 "Send in the army!"
bel.1.c:0 "We should wait for them to calm down"
bel.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Belgium!"
bel.2.d:0 "On the 2nd of February the German Stock Market crashed resulting in an economic crisis like never before. Belgium, already weakened by the reparations and reconstruction of its country has been hit very hard. Hundreds left the Brussels stock exchange crying and screaming. A Drastic action will be required to save the struggling people of Belgium."
bel.2.a:0 "What will we do?" 
bel.3.t:0 "Send in the Troops"
bel.3.d:0 "The closest division was mobilised and started to open fire on the protesters, killing 103. This was able to calm them down temporarily but we will have to take drastic action to make sure this doesn't happen again."
bel.3.a:0 "You can now reform the Government"
bel.4.t:0 "Make small concessions"
bel.4.d:0 "After summoning Parliament the King decided it was time for change."
bel.4.a:0 "You can now reform the Government"
bel.5.t:0 "Wait for them to calm down"
bel.5.d:0 "After many considerations the King decided to stay put in the palace and wait out the protest. The Protest however started to spread to Leuven and soon the students of the KUL started to march through the streets waving the Belgian flag."
bel.5.a:0 "Its only growing worse!"
bel.6.t:0 "Walloons in Charleroi and Mons rise up"
bel.6.d:0 "With the protest raging in Flemish Brabant the Syndicalists of Hainaut see their chance and lay down their work. Thousands of protesters gather in the cities and demand more representation and the expulsion of all German forces."
bel.6.a:0 "Will this never end?"
bel.7.t:0 "Mass Desertion"
bel.7.d:0 "As the riots continue and the movements keep growing, many of the soldiers of the former Belgian Army have deserted leaving the army dangerously understaffed." 
bel.7.a:0 "Ask German reinforcements"
bel.7.b:0 "We can handle this on our own!"
bel.8.t:0 "Support for Independence grows"
bel.8.d:0 "As the different factions keep growing there will soon be a choice to be made to decide what the future of Belgium will be. For the moment there is little contact between the Walloon rebels and the Flemish. It might be in our best interest to keep the situation separated until we can crack the rebellion down."
bel.8.a:0 "Keep them separated and we will prevail!"
bel.8.b:0 "We can't spare the resources at the moment."
bel.9.t:0 "Mayday"
bel.9.d:0 "On the first of May the syndicalists celebrate the fight for the 8-hour workday as described by the second Internationale in 1889. Despite the rebellion raging on throughout Belgium many syndicalists decided to take a break for the celebrations. This could be our opportunity to strike back!"
bel.9.a:0 "Perform coordinated strikes against key figures."
bel.9.b:0 "Install a curfew in Liege, Namur and Charleroi."
bel.9.c:0 "It may be too dangerous to provoke them any further."
bel.10.t:0 "Assassination attempts have Failed!"
bel.10.d:0 "During the assault by our troops on the Charleroi Headquarters one of the soldiers who sympathised with the syndicalist cause turned his back on his fellow soldiers and lured them into a trap. Syndicalist forces could quickly capture the rest of his unit and are holding them hostage."
bel.10.a:0 "Is there nothing we can do right?"
bel.11.t:0 "Syndicalists and Royalists unite!"
bel.11.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the Royalists and Syndicalists have made a pact and set aside their differences until German occupation has come to an end."
bel.11.a:0 "They have only made themselves a bigger target!"
bel.12.t:0 "Syndicalists stand alone"
bel.12.d:0 "After we successfully cut the communications between Flemish and Walloon resistance, the syndicalists of Wallonia stand alone. With no real way to get support for their own free syndicalist state, they will have to seek aid from France."
bel.12.a:0 "Finally a victory!"
bel.13.t:0 "Syndicalists strike back!"
bel.13.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the syndicalists are planning a massive terrorist attack on our infrastructure. We are however unable to reinforce both the army bases and our industrial complexes so we need to make a choice."
bel.13.a:0 "Protect the Army!"
bel.13.b:0 "Protect our Industry!"
bel.14.t:0 "Status Flemish Resistance"
bel.14.d:0 "While we were trying to counter the Walloon syndicalists the Flemish decided to work more underground and have been recruiting members into their movement. They also performed small, coordinated raids against German transports and have been able to acquire quite the armoury. It's not yet clear what they are up to but it would be wise to reinforce our control over Flandres."
bel.14.a:0 "Fall back into Antwerp, Limburg and Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.b:0 "Fall back into Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.c:0 "Reinforce all provinces!"
bel.15.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.15.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With the temporary retreat of the German forces the Flemish Resistance memorises this day and has proclaimed the 11th of July a national holiday."
bel.15.a:0 "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"
bel.16.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.16.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With German forces spread thin to surpress the resistance the Flemish Resistance has prepared a massive attack to liberate the cities of Bruges, Gent, Kortrijk and Oostende. Due to our small forces we were quickly overrun and after 5 hours of heavy fighting our last stronghold at the Gravensteen in Ghent fell and the Flemish Lion proudly waves atop its battlements."
bel.16.a:0 "We have lost control over West and East Flandres!"
bel.17.t:0 "Flemish offer a deal"
bel.17.d:0 "After the loss of great parts of Flandres, the Flemish Resistance has proposed a deal. They demand independence from Flandres-Wallonia and immediate retreat off all German forces out of Flandres. In exchange they are willing to remain part of Mittel-Europa and fulfil their role as buffer state and will not aid the Syndicalists in Wallonia in their struggle."
bel.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept these demands."
bel.17.b:0 "Never! How dare they assume we would accept their proposal!"
bel.18.t:0 "Walloons hear of Flemish Victories"
bel.18.d:0 "After the victories of the Flemish Resistance over the German forces the Walloons will have to decide whether or not to work together with the Flemish for an unified Belgium, to fight for an independent Wallonia or to join the French Commune. The syndicalists are neighed to join the commune and spread the revolution. The royalists would prefer to work together with the Flemish to unify the country and reinstate the king. After days of discussion the doors of the headquarters finally open and the decision is announced."
bel.18.a:0 "We shall seek Unification with the French Commune and help spread the revolution to the German Reich."
bel.18.b:0 "We shall approach our Flemish brethren and try to reinstate Belgium."
bel.19.t:0 "Flandres receives Walloon Deal"
bel.19.d:0 "After the proposal to the German government has failed, the Flemish receive a deal from the Walloon movement. They ask the Flemish to work together with them to ensure Independence for all of Belgium and to reinstate the King."
bel.19.a:0 "Flandres shall be Independent!"
bel.19.b:0 "-"Eendracht maakt Macht!""L'union fait la force!""Unity is Strength!""
bel.20.t:0 "Hainaut Attacks"
bel.20.d:0 "After the Flemish and Walloons made their pact to unify Belgium, they launched an assault on the German Administration Offices in Mons and secured the governor and his family. They are now held hostage and are demanding retreat of German Forces out of Hainaut. We have surrounded the building and are ready to move in if necessary. The chances of extracting the governor successfully are slim but we could re-secure the building to reinforce it against further attacks."
bel.20.a:0 "Launch an Assault on the building!"
bel.20.b:0 "We will have to give in."
bel.21.t:0 "Hainaut secured."
bel.21.d:0 "After we stormed the building the rebels immediately executed the hostages and kept fighting to the last man. We were however able to retake the building with minimal losses and have established a perimeter. Barbed wire and machine gun posts were quickly installed to deter any further attack and part of the city has been evacuated to make place for the 2nd Walloon Division to set up camp."
bel.21.a:0 "Very well."
bel.22.t:0 "Rebels push into Antwerp"
bel.22.d:0 "With renewed forces and with help from Wallonia the Flemish Resistance pushes into Antwerp. Fighting in the streets ensues immediately and for 3 days there seems to be no clear winner until a tank depot falls to the Flemish forces and the Germans retreat to the east side of the city. At the same time a push was orchestrated towards Boom and Dendermonde ensuring liberation of most of the province Antwerp."
bel.22.a:0 "Fall back to Brussels"
bel.23.t:0 "Flemish forces approach the capital"
bel.23.d:0 "With their victories in Antwerp and the retreat of German forces out of Limburg we are left with only Brussels and Wallonia. As the movement keeps winning they gather more support and by now they heavily outnumber us. The only forces we have left are the division located in Brussels and one in Wallonia. Now we will have to make a very important decision. Will we retreat into Germany, thus liberating Belgium or will we dig in and try to hold out as long as we can, hoping that Germany may recover quickly enough to support us?"
bel.23.a:0 "We will not risk any more German blood."
bel.23.b:0 "Dig in boys, its gonna be a though fight!"
bel.24.t:0 "German forces return to Germany"
bel.24.d:0 "On September 13th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace signs the former King Adalbert the Ceasefire resulting in his immediate abdication, the return of all German forces to Germany and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Reich. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children run into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
bel.24.a:0 "-"Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""
bel.25.t:0 "Germans pushed back into Namur"
bel.25.d:0 "After our defeat at Mons and in return for the governor we have fallen back into Namur where we dug ourselves in. Any Walloon resistance will have to deal with our position and prepared troops!"
bel.25.a:0 "Watch out, those Walloons are everywhere!"
bel.26.t:0 "No further attack"
bel.26.d:0 "The Walloons have set up a perimeter around the city but aren't planning to immediately attack the city. They may be trying to secure Flanders first before moving any further."
bel.26.a:0 "Keep a close look on them"
bel.27.t:0 "Frontal Assault"
bel.27.d:0 "With our troops firmly dug in and awaiting the Rebel attack, news reaches us of a German Division stationed in German Wallonia being re-positioned to Namur to help ward off the attack. The Rebels however have intercepted this message and have decided to attack as soon as they can. The troops surrounding Brussels move in under artillery support and the tanks captured in Antwerp swiftly breach our first line of defence. This is followed up by intense fighting in the metropolitan area of Brussels and is especially fierce in Schaarbeek en Dilbeek. Here the soldiers fight for every wall and heavy casualties on both sides occur. After 8 hours of heavy fighting our garrison is no longer able to keep them off and the rebel army marches on the palace."
bel.27.a:0 "Retreat to Namur"
bel.27.b:0 "Surrender to the Rebels"
bel.28.t:0 "Last Stand of Flandres-Wallonia"
bel.28.d:0 "Pushed back out of Brussels, the remaining army falls back into the city of Namur. Here the reinforcements from the German Reich have arrived and we are able to set up an adequate defence. We do however have a limited amount of supplies left after our defeat at Brussels and will most likely have to surrender within 3 months if we do not launch a counter-offensive."
bel.28.a:0 "Our situation is hopeless, we have to surrender"
bel.28.b:0 "Launch a counter-offensive on the Walloon perimeter"
bel.29.t:0 "Counter-offensive"
bel.29.d:0 "At 6:32 AM German artillery placed on top of the hill opened fire on the Walloon defences. They were followed up by an infantry assault trying to breach their line. Waves after waves of brave Germans threw themselves at the line but at 11:16 AM they had to retreat. The offensive has failed. German troops are exhausted and the Walloon line still stands."
bel.29.a:0 "Surrender to the rebels"
bel.30.t:0 "Ask for French support"
bel.30.d:0 "Cut of from the Flemish resistance, with not enough support to frontally assault the German government it seems that asking aid from the Internationale is the only thing the Syndicalists can do to prevent the failure of their struggle. France might however not be interested in such an arrangement not to anger the German Reich and might deny their proposal."
bel.30.a:0 "Those Baguettes wouldn't dare challenge our might!"
bel.31.t:0 "French decision"
bel.31.d:0 "As the French weigh all their options they decide their course of action. They will either invade Wallonia indicating an attack on German land and as such a second Weltkrieg. Or they will deny support to Wallonia thus dooming their rebellion."
bel.31.a:0 "The French invade!"
bel.31.b:0 "No further French support"
bel.32.t:0 "Beginning of the Second Weltkrieg!"
bel.32.d:0 "As planes soar over the Walloon countryside, infantry battalions move into Wallonia. French aid has come and the Second Weltkrieg is about to begin. With Germany severly weakened by Black Monday it will have to be seen if they can defend against the French hordes."
bel.32.a:0 "A dark day for Germany and therefor the world!"
bel.33.t:0 "Eradicate the Syndicalist uprising!"
bel.33.d:0 "With no further support the Walloon rebellion will be dealt with in due time and we can concentrate more of our power on the Flemish front."
bel.33.a:0 "Did they really think they could defeat us?"
bel.34.t:0 "The Kingdom strikes back"
bel.34.d:0 "With no support from the other side of the language border and outgunned by the German government the rebellion is doomed to fail. Repression by us will be hard but righteous as we will try to avoid any further rebellions. The government will have to be reformed to make sure that we are better prepared next time."
bel.34.a:0 "Let's get on with it!"
bel.35.t:0 "The Belgian Flag"
bel.35.d:0 "After our victory over the German occupiers, the temporary government has decided to reinstate the Belgian flag to bolster morale and to show the world that Belgium is free once more."
bel.35.a:0 "Black Yellow Red once more!"
bel.36.t:0 "Who will take control?"
bel.36.d:0 "With the German king abdicated and the country liberated it's finally time to reshape Belgium into a free and prosperous power. There is however no clear leader and rebuilding an able government might not be an easy task. Four main parties are vying for the office of prime minister. The KP/DC or Christian party has ruled Belgium for many years and is known for their conservative and Christian view. Rex/VNV known for their populist and right leaning ideas stand for a strong and independent Belgium relying on its army and industry. BWP or the syndicalist party stands for a Workers First policy and will try to revive the Belgian industry with it's famous Plan De Man. Finally we have the LP or Liberals who stand for a Belgian Republic and a Laissez Faire policy will the industry bounce back on its own."
bel.36.a:0 "Rex/Verdinaso will make Belgium great again!"
bel.36.b:0 "KP/DC will return Belgium to its old glory!"
bel.36.c:0 "BWP will be able to end the Black Monday Crisis!"
bel.36.e:0 "LP will bring back our rights!"
bel.37.t:0 "Leader of the government?"
bel.37.d:0 "As Rex/Verdinaso takes control of the government they decide who is going to lead them. The main candidates are Léon Degrelle, leader of the Walloon Rex and Joris Van Severen, leader of the Flemish Verdinaso. Choosing Rex over Verdinaso might result in more focus on Wallonia and vice-versa."
bel.37.a:0 "Rex will lead the government!"
bel.37.b:0 "Verdinaso will lead the government!"
bel.38.t:0 "KP will lead Belgium!"
bel.38.d:0 "As the largest Belgian Party and controller of the government from 1884 to 1921 it was the obvious choice to pick KP to rebuild the country. Head of the party Paul Van Zeeland has been tasked with forming the government and will hopefully guide us to a better Belgium."
bel.38.a:0 "Good Luck Van Zeeland!"
bel.39.t:0 "BWP will lead Belgium!"
bel.39.d:0 "As the largest socialist party of Belgium and with great plans to revive Belgium it comes as no surprise that the BWP has been appointed to lead the government. There are however two candidates vying for the place of Prime Minister. Paul-Henri Spaak, a strong socialist with ideas very close to the KPB and anti-war will try to launch great infrastructure overhauls to boost the working class. Hendrik De Man on the other hand is more closely leaning to the social-democratic side and will revive the Belgian economy with his famous Plan De Man."
bel.39.a:0 "Paul-Henri Spaak will lead the government"
bel.39.b:0 "Hendrik De Man will lead the government" 
bel.40.t:0 "LP leads the government"
bel.40.d:0 "The elections are over and the Liberal party has won. Though it has been a long time since the liberals lead the Belgian government a fresh wind may be necessary to rebuild the ruined country. The Liberals may not have as grand ambitions as the BWP or Rex/Verdinaso, they believe that little state control and more rights for the citizen are the way to go."
bel.40.a:0 "Good Luck Janson!" 
bel.41.t:0 "King Albert I returns!"
bel.41.d:0 "As the catholics restore the monarchy King Albert I,formerly known as Van Saksen-Coburg Gotha, now as Van België, sets sail in Canada as the first king restored to his country. Over in Belgium all preparations are made for Albert to swiftly and without issues remount his throne."
bel.41.a:0 "Long live Albert I!"
bel.42.t:0 "Plan De Man"
bel.42.d:0 "With Hendrik De Man and his syndicalist government firmly in control, they start to unravel the first phases of their plan. To combat the depression caused by Black Monday they have decided to switch to a planned economy. This plan consists of the creation of 5 Economic Secretaries led by technocrats to oversee the further steps. They will have the primary task to rebuild the country by reducing unemployment and starting to nationalise the Basic Industries. With these industries under control they will then better be able to guide Belgium to economic stability and prevent another crisis."
bel.42.a:0 "Very well"
bel.43.t:0 "Plan Spaak"
bel.43.d:0 "With Paul-Henri Spaak and his syndicalist government firmly in control, they start to unravel the first phases of their plan. To combat the depression caused by Black Monday they have decided to switch to state capitalism. They will start by reforming the ministries into one strong government who will invest heavily in large scale construction projects to reduce unemployment. They will instate smaller provincial councils to better listen to the needs of the people and will try to abstain as much as possible from military matters focusing on rebuilding the economy."
bel.43.a:0 "Very well"
bel.44.t:0 "Foundation of the Belgian republic"
bel.44.d:0 "With the Liberal party firmly in Belgium can finally start moving towards a republic. Governed by dukes, kings and emperors for all of their history, the Belgian people have decided to renounce the monarchy and move towards a decentralised government. They will turn Belgium into a liberal state letting the free market decide the economy and posing as little restrictions as possible on the Belgian people."
bel.44.a:0 "Very well"
bel.45.t:0 "Reinforce National Unity"
bel.45.d:0 "With Rex/Verdinaso firmly in control of the government they start to unravel their plan. They will try to strengthen their position by eliminating the opposition and re-militarise Belgium. Then they will seek a preferably weak target to attack. Nothing strengthens the country more than a common enemy, no? Soon the world shall feel the power of an united Belgium!"
bel.45.a:0 "Very well"
bel.46.t:0 "Treaty of Arles"
bel.46.d:0 "Deep in the Ardennes, in the city of Arles, German and Belgian representatives have gathered to discuss the future relations between the two countries. Multiple proposals have been put on the table by both side until finally an agreement was reached. Belgium would stay in Mittel-Europa and help the German Reich in its wars in exchange for German Wallonia and part of the Kongo. After much debate the Germans reluctantly agreed to cede Wallonia but are not yet willing to give up Kongo. The Belgian prime minister now has the word and declares that"
bel.46.a:0 "Belgium agrees with the treaty as it stands"
bel.46.b:0 "Belgium will only accept in exchange for the Kongo!"
bel.47.t:0 "No treaty this year"
bel.47.d:0 "The German Reich has refused our proposal and has decided to leave the summit. There will be no alliance this time and no concessions."
bel.47.a:0 "We will seek other allies"
bel.48.t:0 "Treaty has been signed"
bel.48.d:0 "With the Belgian government agreeing to the German terms, the treaty has been signed. Germany will cede Wallonia when the agreements are all in order and we will in exchange join their faction."
bel.48.a:0 "Together we stand strong"
bel.49.t:0 "Flanders seeks Dutch aid"
bel.49.d:0 "Refusing to join the Walloons in reuniting Belgium, the Flemish seek aid from their neighbours, the Dutch, to help them in their struggle. Without Dutch aid Flanders is doomed to fail so the succes of the rebellion depends on the Dutch support."
bel.49.a:0 "The Dutch agree to support us"
bel.49.b:0 "The Dutch refuse to support us"
bel.50.t:0 "End of the Flemish Resistance"
bel.50.d:0 "With no support from the Dutch nor Walloons, the Flemish resistance will slowly get pushed back by the better equipped German Empire."
bel.50.a:0 "We will put a swift end to this rebellion!"
bel.51.t:0 "Treaty of Terneuzen"
bel.51.d:0 "The Dutch have agreed to support us but will only keep reinforcing us if we sign the Treaty of Terneuzen. With this treaty the Flemish agree to rejoin the Netherlands after their victory over the Germans, as such reverting the 1830 Independence. Even though this treaty strongly benefits the Netherlands, we might have no choice but to sign as without their continued support we might quickly get overwhelmed by German troops."
bel.51.a:0 "Flandres signs"
bel.51.b:0 "We will never give up our independence!"
bel.52.t:0 "We have Refused!"
bel.53.t:0 "Schelde Discussion"
bel.53.d:0 "Ever since the treaty of London we have been relying on the Dutch to dredge the Westerschelde. Without this, the harbour of Antwerp can't be reached by the large cargo ships thus hindering our trade potential. As the south bank of the river is mainly populated by Flemish people we propose that the Dutch government helps us in exchange for us abandoning our claim on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen."
bel.53.a:0 "Let's hope they agree"
bel.54.t:0 "Schelde Discussion"
bel.54.d:0 "As we hold control of the Westerschelde we decide which ships leave and enter the harbour of Antwerp. The Belgians however have asked us that we help them out by dredging the Westerschelde in exchange for them abandoning their claim on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen."
bel.54.a:0 "We will gladly help our southern friends"
bel.54.b:0 "Which claim?"
bel.55.t:0 "Dutch agree"
bel.55.d:0 "With support from the Dutch government we should be able to expand the harbour."
bel.55.a:0 "Antwerp will once again take its place on the world map!"
bel.56.t:0 "Dutch Refuse"
bel.56.d:0 "With refusal from the Dutch government to co-operate it seems that we will only get our goal by war."
bel.56.a:0 "Then war it shall be!"
bel.57.t:0 "Choose Military Investment"
bel.57.d:0 "As we are just a small country we will have to choose a focus for our investments in the military. We could choose to expand our navy and be able to better defend our coasts or we could focus on building some armour regiments so we can better defend ourselves on land."
bel.57.a:0 "Navy first"
bel.57.b:0 "Armour first"
bel.58.t:0 "Naval Effort"
bel.58.d:0 "We have decided to spend our extra resources in rebuilding the Belgian navy. After the Belgian navy was sunk by German mines in the Weltkrieg, we were given 4 destroyers as compensation at the end of the war. This is however not enough to express any power over the seas. Therefore we will fund a commission tasked with looking into naval expansion possibilities."
bel.58.a:0 "Rule Belgium, Belgium rules the waves!"
bel.59.t:0 "Choose primal naval base"
bel.59.d:0 "The commission we have instated has returned for their first report. They have started with seeking the best location for our naval base. Two main possibilities were deemed worthy of our attention, the North Sea harbour of Zeebrugge and the Schelde harbour of Antwerp. The advantage of building our base in Zeebrugge would be that it's closest to our dockyards and cannot be blocked by the Dutch. Antwerp on the other hand has the advantage of providing a safe harbour for our fleet in case we need to fall back."
bel.59.a:0 "Zeebrugge"
bel.59.b:0 "Antwerp"
bel.60.t:0 "Naval Focus"
bel.60.d:0 "For the second time the naval commission has gathered with the head of state to discuss the naval plans. This time they have proposed three main focuses for our navy. We can either focus on Destroyers, Submarines or Cruisers. Plans for a large fleet as was proposed earlier deemed impossible and were quickly rejected."
bel.60.a:0 "Focus on Destroyers"
bel.60.b:0 "Focus on Submarines"
bel.60.c:0 "Focus on Cruisers"
bel.61.t:0 "Focus on Destroyers"
bel.61.d:0 "For the third time the commission has gathered, this time to look a proposals for expanding our destroyer fleet. Two main proposals lie on the table. We can either build them ourselves, a costly and lengthy procedure, or we can buy them from our Dutch neighbours, a cheap and quick procedure but with no longtime benefits."
bel.61.a:0 "We will build them ourselves"
bel.61.b:0 "We will buy Dutch destroyers"
bel.62.t:0 "Focus on Cruisers"
bel.62.d:0 "For the third time the commission has gathered, this time to look a proposals for expanding our cruiser fleet. Two main proposals lie on the table. We can either build them ourselves, a costly and lengthy procedure, or we can buy them from our German neighbours, a cheap and quick procedure but with no longtime benefits."
bel.62.a:0 "We will build them ourselves"
bel.62.b:0 "We will buy German cruisers"
bel.63.t:0 "Focus on Submarines"
bel.63.d:0 "For the third time the commission has gathered, this time to look a proposals for expanding our submarine fleet. As we would prefer our neighbours don't know the size of our submarine fleet we have no choice but to build them ourselves."
bel.63.a:0 "We will build them ourselves"
bel.64.t:0 "Expand Zeebrugge"
bel.64.d:0 "As decided on the earlier meetings the commission has given the order to expand the dry-docks of the harbour of Zeebrugge so we can start expanding our fleet."
bel.64.a:0 "Very well"
bel.65.t:0 "Buy Dutch Destroyers"
bel.65.d:0 "With the transactions complete the Destroyers bought from the Dutch await their crews in the Dutch harbour, ready to join our fleet."
bel.65.a:0 "At last"
bel.66.t:0 "Buy German Cruisers"
bel.66.d:0 "With the transactions complete the Cruiser bought from the Germans awaits his crew in the German harbour, ready to join our fleet."
bel.66.a:0 "At last"
bel.67.t:0 "Armour Design"
bel.67.d:0 "With the decree signed that Belgium will create a specialised armour division, a decision will have to be made between the German design, focused on medium tanks, or the Belgian design, focused on light tanks and with a heavy emphasis on tank destroyers."
bel.67.a:0 "Belgian Design"
bel.67.b:0 "German Design"
bel.68.t:0 "German Tanks ready"
bel.68.d:0 "Our factories have prepared their first batch of German tanks and are ready to enter mass production."
bel.68.a:0 "Very well"
bel.69.t:0 "Belgian Tanks ready"
bel.69.d:0 "Our factories have prepared their first batch of Belgian tanks and are ready to enter mass production."
bel.69.a:0 "Very well"
