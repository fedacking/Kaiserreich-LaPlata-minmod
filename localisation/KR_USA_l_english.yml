USA_long_farmer_relief:0 "Farmer Relief act"

USA_alien_sedition_acts:0 "Espionage and Sedition Act"
USA_alien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "Garner and Congress are active to punish all those who would rebel against the United States.

USA_return_to_normalcy:0 "Banking Reform Act"

### Leader descriptions ###
POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "A writer, a trade union leader, a Senator, a journalist and a Syndicalist - John 'Jack' Reed is many things. After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States, Herbert Hoover has solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party is turning away from him."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Hated by foreign governments and by his own people for being the first dictator of the United States, Commander-in-Chief Douglas MacArthur is no weakling. Brought in by the American establishment to rid the country of radicalism, this general runs the nation just like he used to lead his regiment - with order, strict discipline and heavy punishment for all who speak out against him. He sincerely believes that he is here to save the United States - but would the Founding Fathers even support his actions?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "It's hard to say what the Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long exactly stands for. Some would say that his 'Share Our Wealth' program is clearly just Syndicalism in new clothing, while others would point at his undemocratic, nepotist style of rule, topped by the usage of the 'Minutemen' paramilitary to harass rivals, as a sign of his National Populist stance. Whatever may be the case, President Long is liked by the common classes, his charisma is exceptional, even if he can get arrogant at times, and his foothold over the south is not to be underestimated."

### Events ###
ustates.501.t:0 "America in 1936"
ustates.501.d:0 "The United States in 1936 stands in crisis. The United States was able to escape in the first Weltkrieg. Which allowed its prosperity to continue well into the 1920s. However the victory by the German Empire and the French and later British Revolutions would lead to the wall street crash of 1925. This sent the United States into the Great Depression and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place in the world. The election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 showed promise of fixing America, however Hoover was unable to fix the problems of the Depression. This has fuelled the rise of radical parties in America from the Combined Syndicates of America on the Far Left and the American First Party on the Far Right. The fact that Hoover won re-election by the House of Representatives in 1932 and the fact that the Great Depression isn't over means that the problems do not look to be going away soon. Many throughout the country fear that disaster will happen should one of the extreme parties come into power or nothing is done to solve the Depression."
ustates.501.a:0 "God Save America!"

ustates.1.t:0 "A Day In September"
ustates.1.d:0 "The social and political consensus in American society has broken down, and the current Presidential Election Campaign is like nothing we have ever seen. The America First-Union party is organising right-wing militias in the South and Mid-West, and Syndicalists control the streets of Chicago and Detroit. To avoid a complete breakdown of our society, some of our senior military commanders believe that it may be necessary to suspend the Constitution and cancel the election."

ustates.1.b:0 "Invite the military to step in to save the country!"
ustates.2.t:0 "Emergency Security Act"
ustates.2.d:0 "MacArthur's first act was to reestablish order on the streets of America. He proposed the Emergency Security Act which would give MacArthur the power to arrest and detain suspected members of un-American organisations. This was a thin cover for MacArthurs anti-socialist agenda, and with the support of the America First it was more than likely going to be enacted."

ustates.4.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully this will gain us some sympathy!"
ustates.4.b:0 "Veto the Bill."
ustates.5.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"
ustates.5.d:0 "In Detroit, Michigan, the Automotive Capital of the World, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankensteen, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for 'Unionism, Not Fordism', demanding higher pay and less hours for automotive workers. \n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat up on them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
ustates.5.a:0 "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"
ustates.6.t:0 "The Great Heat Wave of '36"
ustates.6.d:0 "A Heat Wave has struck the continental United States and Canada. The most severe heat wave in the Modern History of North America, 'The Great Heat Wave' started in late June, and went up over 100°F (38°C) as drought conditions worsened due to a continued lack of rain. Now, in July, the heat has reached all time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934. \n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist mobs and militias gathering arms in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this Heat Wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."

The State of California had invested over $25 million into the new project and had faced slow construction due to the stagnant economy, but will soon be able to reap the benifits of their labor."

The comedy film, featuring Chaplin's famous Little Tramp character, is seen as a anti-capitalist and anti-fordist manifesto in favour of the Combined Syndicates of America. After a few days, it is censored by the federal government, judged as too provocative so shortly before the election."
ustates.10.a:0 "So bad, it was funny."
ustates.11.t:0 "Vice-President Curtis recovers"
ustates.11.d:0 "Many in America feared the worst when Vice President Charles Curtis, presumptive Republican nominee to succeed President Hoover, suffered a heart attack earlier this morning.

ustates.157.t:0 "The Constitutional Ban"
ustates.157.d:0 "MacArthur was prepared for extreme action in dealing with both the America First Party and Combined Syndicates. He attacked both parties as being prepared to use the election to destroy the American constitution and thus prepared to pass an act to ban both the parties from participating in the election.

ustates.15.t:0 "The Crackdown"
ustates.15.d:0 "After passing the act MacArthur moved to defeat the groups that had been causing the most problems for the country.

ustates.18.a:0 "They'll pay"

ustates.19.t:0 "MacArthur and Reed"
ustates.19.d:0 "MacArthur agreed to listen to Reed's requests in an attempt to resolve the dispute but the demands put forth were extreme.

ustates.22.b:0 "Not a chance"

ustates.23.t:0 "Country Wide Crackdown"
ustates.23.d:0 "MacArthur sent federal troops coast to coast to deal with both the CSA and the America First. The nation wide sweep led to the arrests of several America First and CSA leaders.

ustates.37.t:0 "Establishing the Minute Men"
ustates.37.d:0 "One of Longs first actions was to establish a paramilitary organisation to deal with issues involving disruptive trade unions and other socialist rabble rousers.

ustates.38.d:0 "In spring of 1937, with the country still in economic chaos, Long launched a series of reforms to bring the economy and industry under stricter political and corporate control.

ustates.62.t:0 "Nationalising the Resource Industries"
ustates.62.d:0 "Nationalising of all the resource industries in America was easier said than done. Reed was able to nationalise some of the industry, as the CSA and it's unions already controlled it, but others like the oil industry in California resisted."

ustates.75.t:0 "Militias Fail to Restore Order"
ustates.75.d:0 "The relatively disorganised rabble of the CSA militia proved to be nearly useless at restoring order in the south.

ustates.91.d:0 "The paramilitary group the Minute Men were considered nothing more than thugs by most people but Long did not hesitate in offering them as a solution to the security concerns in Chicago. The presence of the Minute Men would no doubt aggravate the situation with Reed and the CSA."

ustates.110.t:0 "Garner Drops Reforms"

ustates.147.d:0 "MacArthur privately met with the President today and made a shocking proposal- the assassination of Huey Long. Analysis of reports from spies from within the America First Party indicated that the entire movement would tear itself apart without his charismatic leadership, and while it might lead to extensive rioting, it was definitely preferable to an organised uprising, which appeared more and more likely as the days wore on."

He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'foremented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in.

ustates.176.d:0 "President MacArthur who is even not President de jure has to make his mind up whatever he wants to throw away Constitution or to keep deprived of power the Senate and House of Representatives. First option would be really hard to accept for many Americans, including the most influential military officers and civilians. Creating the totalitarian state is tempting option but it can lead to great divisions in society. The second option leaves the democratic appearance and allow s MacArthur's junta to fully control the state. Counter-intelligence officials and secret police is warning us about rising discontent in many circles including the army, so perhaps it's the best to appear democratic!"

Even some capital ships of our navy have switched allegiance to the Sacramento clique! In order to restore the rule of law, as the saying goes, 'from sea to shining sea', our military leaders have devised a plan for an immediate police action against the rebel PSA to forcibly return those states to the Union. Resistance is expected to be high, however, since many civilians and most of the military are now giving value to their newly-gained independence as a bulwark against the chaos that engulfed the rest of the country. Even on our own home states, the common folk is more interested in returning to their towns and rebuilding their life's than on another round of this fratricidal civil war - if we go ahead with this invasion, we will surely see a new set of major protests on our cities.
