### Events ###
xibei.0.t:0 "The Land of the Mas"
xibei.0.d:0 "In the far northwest of China, one finds the Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan. Ruled by a loose alliance among the warlords of the area, with the two large Ma families having the most influence and with the ever power-hungry Mongolian Baron Ungern Von Sternberg looking hungrily at the weak state, the future looks grim for the federation. But not all is hopeless. Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan possesses a powerful army, especially noted are it's fearsome cavalry, and it may be able to turn the tide against any, who would dare threaten their land. Once the threats of Mongolia, and perhaps even Tibet, has been removed, one could perhaps centralise and reform the obsolete administrative and state system."
xibei.0.a:0 "For China! For Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan! For the Ma's!"
xibei.1.t:0 "The Mongolians are upon us!"
xibei.1.d:0 "The wretched Mongolians have successfully carried out the initial phase of their assault against our homeland and have penetrated deeply into the heart of the country. In order to save ourselves from total destruction, some commanders suggest arming the civilian populations, to let them fight for their freedom..."
xibei.1.a:0 "To arms!"
xibei.1.b:0 "This is not needed!"
xibei.2.t:0 "The Mongolians have been defeated!"
xibei.2.d:0 "We've finally defeated Mongolia and it's crazed Baron! But what do we do with the new land? Several prominent Mas, such as Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, want to occupy and claim the Mongolian provinces. A smaller group, however, believes we should create a new Mongolian state with a Ma head of state."
xibei.2.a:0 "Occupy and claim the area!"
xibei.2.b:0 "Create a new Mongolian state."
xibei.3.t:0 "New ruler of Mongolia"
xibei.3.d:0 "Now that we've decided to release a Mongolian puppet, we need to assign a proper leader to guide them. There's several candidates for this position. The young Ma Zhongying is the most popular choice. But others, like Ma Shaowu and the pious Ma Lin, have similar hopes to be appointed."
xibei.3.a:0 "The young Ma Zhongying is the obvious choice."
xibei.3.b:0 "Ma Lin should be the ruler."
xibei.3.c:0 "Ma Shaowu deserves the position."
xibei.4.t:0 "Ma Zhongying is the new Head of State."
xibei.4.d:0 "The victorious Ma state has decided on our new head of state. We must comply."
xibei.4.a:0 "Long live Ma Zhongying!"
xibei.4.t:0 "Ma Lin is the new Head of State."
xibei.5.d:0 "The victorious Ma state has decided on our new head of state. We must comply."
xibei.5.a:0 "Long live Ma Lin!"
xibei.6.t:0 "Ma Shaowu is the new Head of State."
xibei.6.d:0 "The victorious Ma state has decided on our new head of state. We must comply."
xibei.6.a:0 "Long live Ma Shaowu!"
xibei.7.t:0 "The future of Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan"
xibei.7.d:0 "Now that we've defeated our most worrisome enemy, we can look inwards. Currently, our federation is weak and divided from within, but perhaps we could centralise power? This could, however, have some consequences. Many of the Mas, as well as other influential leaders, are directly opposed to any strong central rule, as this could have dire consequences for their personal rule."
xibei.7.a:0 "Let us call for an assembly in Xining."
xibei.7.b:0 "Maintain status quo!"
xibei.7.c:0 "Ma Hongkui proclaims himself the ruler of the Federation!"
xibei.8.t:0 "Ma Hongkui - The Ma Dictator"
xibei.8.d:0 "Ma Hongkui's proclamation as the sole ruler of the Federation has caused a great stir in the nation. Several prominent leaders have openly opposed this move, and are now marching on the capital. Meanwhile, in the countryside, several open revolts have broken out. The nation seems to be falling apart."
xibei.8.a:0 "Ma Hongkui will fight to the bitter end!"
xibei.9.t:0 "The great assembly of Xining."
xibei.9.d:0 "Our call for an assembly has been answered and all prominent leaders of the federation has gathered in Xining to discuss the future of the state. Great discussions are being held, but many seem to agree that a united government is needed to keep the new dangers of the future in check. The three most influential people, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin, are discussed as possible leaders of such a government. But nothing is certain yet, and there is still great opposition among certain parts of the elite."
xibei.9.a:0 "Let the discussions commence!"
xibei.10.t:0 "Positive result!"
xibei.10.d:0 "The leaders at the Xining assembly has finally come to a conclusion. They've managed to come to terms and will accept a united leader without any bloodshed. This is a great day for our Federation."
xibei.10.a:0 "Huzzah!"
xibei.11.t:0 "Horrible result!"
xibei.11.d:0 "The leaders at the Xining assembly couldn't agree on the issue, and several have now left the assembly in anger, and have pronounced the Federation to be dead! Ma Hongkui on the other decided to use this opportunity to become sole ruler of the entire state..."
xibei.11.a:0 "Oh no!"
xibei.12.t:0 "Sheng Shih-tsai breaks away!"
xibei.12.d:0 "Our general Sheng Shih-tsai have cut all relations with our Federation, and has created a new independent state of Sinkiang in the west. He's taken a number of military commanders with him!"
xibei.12.a:0 "He'll be dead in a few weeks time!"
xibei.13.t:0 "The armies of Sinkiang mobilise"
xibei.13.d:0 "A new army is organised under the warlord Sheng Shih-tsai."
xibei.13.a:0 "We'll show those Mas!"
xibei.14.t:0 "Choosing a leader"
xibei.14.d:0 "Now that the leaders of the Ma Federation have agreed on centralising power, we must choose a new leader. Three candidates have been put forward. Ma Bufang, the great moderniser and reformer, but also an oppressor of minorities. Ma Hongkui, a brutal warlord, who wants a strong state and who has strong anti-leftist views, and finally Ma Hongkui's brother Ma Hongbin, who's the weakest of the candidates. He's expected to fight imperialism, and opposes the Japanese in particular."
xibei.14.a:0 "Ma Bufang, the great moderniser!"
xibei.14.b:0 "Ma Hongkui, the great warlord!"
xibei.14.c:0 "Ma Hongbin, the anti-imperialist!"
xibei.15.t:0 "Ma Bufang chooses his head of government"
xibei.15.d:0 "Now that Ma Bufang is in control, he needs a new Head of Government. Ma Hongbin, Ma Lin, Ma Zhongying, and Ma Shaowu are all candidates for the position."
xibei.15.a:0 "Ma Hongbin will bring the most stability to the new government."
xibei.15.b:0 "Ma Lin will bring experience."
xibei.15.c:0 "Ma Zhongying is young and eager to learn."

xibei.16.t:0 "Ma Hongkui chooses his head of government"
xibei.16.d:0 "Now that Ma Hongkui is in control, he needs a new Head of Government. His brother Ma Hongbin, Ma Lin, Ma Zhongying, and Ma Shaowu are all candidates for the position."

xibei.17.d:0 "Now that Ma Hongbin is in control, he needs a new Head of Government. His brother Ma Hongkui, Ma Lin, Ma Zhongying, and Ma Shaowu are all candidates for the position."
xibei.17.a:0 "Ma Hongbin will bring the most stability to the new government."
xibei.17.b:0 "Ma Lin will bring experience."
xibei.17.c:0 "Ma Zhongying is young and eager to learn."
xibei.17.e:0 "Ma Bufang will help modernise and rule."
xibei.18.t:0 "The failed assembly - What now?"
xibei.18.d:0 "The Xining assembly has only split our Federation apart, with several leaders seeing the Federation as a thing of the past. We must act, if we wish to centralise, but what do we do?"
xibei.18.a:0 "Promise to roll back any reforms in exchange of peace!"
xibei.18.b:0 "If they want to fight, let them!"
xibei.19.t:0 "Ma Hongkui has won the civil war."
xibei.19.d:0 "Despite the huge pressure of the last few months, Ma Hongkui has managed to win the civil war and with it his position as true ruler of Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan is secured. He's now the uncontested leader of the nation."
xibei.19.a:0 "Finally."
xibei.20.t:0 "Choosing our capital"
xibei.20.d:0 "Now that we've finally secured a new head of state, we need to choose a proper capital. Xining, Urumqi, Ge'ermu, or even Lanzhou in the east."
xibei.20.a:0 "Xining"
xibei.20.b:0 "Urumqi"
xibei.20.c:0 "Ge'ermu"
xibei.20.e:0 "Lanzhou"
xibei.21.t:0 "Mongolia in disarray"
xibei.21.d:0 "With the territories of Mongolia in turmoil, we have a great opportunity to seize control of the stolen parts of the Trans-Siberian railway. There is very little that either Mongolia or the Chinese warlords can do to stop us at this point."
xibei.21.a:0 "Seize Northern Mongolia!"
xibei.21.b:0 "Rather not"
xibei.22.t:0 "Mongolia in disarray"
xibei.22.d:0 "With the territories of Mongolia in turmoil, we have a great opportunity to seize control of the stolen parts of the Trans-Siberian railway. There is very little that either Mongolia or the Chinese warlords can do to stop us at this point."

xibei.22.b:0 "This is Too Risky!"
xibei.23.t:0 "Russia seize northern Mongolia!"
xibei.23.d:0 "With our state in chaos Russia used this opportunity to seize control of parts of northern Mongolia. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop Russia at this point."

xibei.24.t:0 "Russia seize northern Mongolia!"
xibei.24.d:0 "With our Mongolian territory in chaos Russia used this opportunity to seize control of northern Mongolia. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop Russia at this point."
