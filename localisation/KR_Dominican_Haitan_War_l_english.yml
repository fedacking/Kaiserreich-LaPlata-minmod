dhw.1.t:0 "Dominican Introduction"
dhw.1.d:0 "In 1844 the Eastern part of the island of Hispaniola, since 1822 a part of the young country Haiti, declared its independence as Dominican Republic. Instability and foreign threats marked the early years of the new state. Restorative tendencies found the support of the oligarchy who, in the face of a border dispute with Haiti, put the country back under Spanish colonial rule in 1861 until revolts forced independence again in 1865. Economically and politically the Dominican Republic became more and more dependant on the U.S.A. who first openly intervened in 1905 to collect debts. Between 1916 and 1924 they occupied the country in order to get control over the financial and military institutions, beginning a democratisation of the state. The military coup of General Rafael Léonidas Trujillo y Molina in 1930 abolished the 1924 constitution again. He went a forceful way to modernise and centralise the country, not looking at the social havoc this caused."

dhw.2.t:0 "Haitian Introduction"
dhw.2.d:0 "The nation of Haiti takes its name from the word used by the local Arawak Indians for the island of Hispanola, which they called 'Hayti', or mountainous land. Owned by the French since the 17th century, Haiti became a particularly rich colony noted for its particularly large proportion of slaves to free Frenchmen. In 1791 Haitians launched a successful slave revolt, and by 1804 were the first independent black nation in the New World. Though there quickly arose a class system with a minority of light-skinned, Catholic, French-speaking Haitians ruling over a dark-skinned, voodoo worshipping, Creole-speaking majority, Haiti soon devolved into chaos after its independence. Haiti's first ruler, the 'Emperor' General Dessalines, was assassinated following his rampant abuse of power. In 1844 Haiti split in two, with the Dominican Republic declaring independence from Haiti. Continuing unrest led to the United States sending in the Marines in 1915, who would occupy the country (and give still more power to the lighter skinned Haitians) until their departure in 1934. Upon the Marine's departure there were many more hospitals and schools but the country still dangerously disunited. A vicious power struggle would soon ensue between Catholic Haitians and those Haitians who follow voodoo. Currently the Catholic mulattos have the upper hand, with a mulatto President, Stenio Vincent, who has ruled since the United States' occupation."
