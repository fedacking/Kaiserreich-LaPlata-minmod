### Events ###
mittel.1.t:0 "The Mittelafrikan Military"
mittel.1.d:0 "There is a problem in our Military, currently both the airforce and the NCOs are made up of German Colonists, however due to Stadhalter Göring's recent expansion of both of these sections of our military, there is a shortage of Germans to recruit into them. Due to this problem, we will have to fill the ranks of either the air force or NCOs with Natives. Which one will it be?"
mittel.1.a:0 "The airforce is our pride and joy! Fill the NCOs"
mittel.1.b:0 "The NCOs are the most important! Fill the airforce"
mittel.2.t:0 "Decolonisation of the Offices"
mittel.2.d:0 "Many in Mittelafrika wish to see us grant natives more power within our government, as a continuation of our policy of giving natives priority in governorship"
mittel.2.a:0 "Power to the natives!"
mittel.2.b:0 "The natives have enough power, we are a German colony after all."
mittel.3.t:0 "Annual Financial Statement of Mittelafrika for the Year of 1937"
mittel.3.d:0 "The Reichstag has begun to examine the financial statements of Germany's colonies for the year 1937. Particular attention was focused on Mittelafrika's financial statements, as this part of the colonial empire frequently requests an increase in budget, which was granted in the past. However, there are unverified reports that a large part of the budget is misused by Staathalter Goering for his personal profit. Members of the SPD and FVP parties are requesting more thorough examinations of Mittelafrikan financial statements to either refute or confirm these reports."
mittel.3.a:0 "The audit finds evidence of corruption in the highest levels!"
mittel.3.b:0 "The audit finds nothing"
mittel.4.t:0 "Goering's Fate"
mittel.4.d:0 "The Reichstag's audit of Mittelafrika has expanded into a general investigation of Mittelafrikan affairs, and what we have found through is alarming. Money laundering, political murders, corruption, embezzlement and more. The source of the corruption was traced to Goering and his self appointed cabinet."
mittel.4.a:0 "Remove him from his office !"
mittel.4.b:0 "Germany values its heroes ! "
mittel.5.t:0 "New statthalter for Mittelafrika"
mittel.5.d:0 "As we got rid of Hermann Goering, after a commission of the Imperial Government found out about his embezzlement schemes, the German Colonial Ministry must now select a new Statthalter (Governor-General) for Mittelafrika. But who will be his replacement? Both Ernst Junger, the conservative Prussian writer and Chief of Staff of the Mittelafrikan Army, and Theodor von Hippel, head of the Mittelafrikan branch of the Abwehr, are the main candidates amongst the Colonial administration. But a reformist faction, seeking to improve relations with the local African elites, is pushing either for Karl Atangana, the loyal paramount chief of the Ewondo people of Niger-Kamerun or for Achirimbi II, the tenth king of Bafut in Kamerun."
mittel.5.a:0 "Ernst Junger, the famous writer!"
mittel.5.b:0 "Theodor von Hippel, the war hero!"
mittel.5.c:0 "Karl Atangana, the paramount chief!"
mittel.5.e:0 "Achirimbi II, the king of Bafut!"
mittel.6.t:0 "The Fate of the Portuguese Colonies"
mittel.6.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, officials both in Berlin and in Dar Es Salaam have had their designs about expansion for the Freistaat Mittelafrika. Most of those plans involved the annexation of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, most notably Angola and Mozambique - true geopolitical anomalies, foreign enclaves within a mighty and huge German colonial holding. Only the Peace with Honour accords, which preserved the colonial empires of the Entente powers after the Great War, has prevented the annexation of these territories. During the 1920s and the early 1930s, Berlin officially abandoned these expansion plans and instead started to rebuild good relations with Portugal. The recent discovery of new major oilfields off the coast of Angola, however, has changed the whole situation. With Germany currently depending on oil supplies from Romania, Persia and Azerbaijan, having a steady source of petroleum within our colonial empire would be a true bliss for the German economy. Now, the question of Portuguese colonies has come up again in the government. Should we try to convince Berlin usefulness of territorial expansion of Mittelafrika, especially now with discovery of oil deposits in Angola?"
mittel.6.a:0 "Run this by Germany first"
mittel.7.t:0 "The Portuguese Colonies in Afrika"
mittel.7.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, officials both in Berlin and in Dar Es Salaam have had their designs about expansion for the Freistaat Mittelafrika. Most of those plans involved the annexation of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, most notably Angola and Mozambique - true geopolitical anomalies, foreign enclaves within a mighty and huge German colonial holding.

The recent discovery of new major oilfields off the coast of Angola, however, has changed the whole situation. With Germany currently depending on oil supplies from Romania, Persia and Azerbaijan, having a steady source of petroleum within our colonial empire would be a true bliss for the German economy. The Staathalter of Mittelafrika, has brought this matter to our attention and seeks our response. Trying to pursue this expansionist agenda, however, would ruin our relations with Portugal, which is one of the few stable anti-Syndicalist countries in Europe and could be a true ally in the coming war against the Internationale."
mittel.7.a:0 "Give Staathalter the Green Light"
mittel.7.b:0 "Portugal's Colonies will remain Untouched!"
mittel.8.t:0 "Berlin approves"
mittel.8.d:0 "The Reichstag has give permission to take control over Portugal's colonies. We can now continue our plans to further expand Mittelafrika...."

mittel.9.t:0 "Berlin Disapproves"
mittel.9.d:0 "The Reichstag refused to give us permission to take control over Portugal's colonies, they are non-negotiable. We must back down from our plans to further expand Mittelafrika...."
mittel.9.a:0 "We have no choice..."
mittel.10.t:0 "Mittelafrika Invades!"
mittel.10.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, the German Empire has been secretly planning to steal our precious African colonies, even more so with the recent discovery of oil in Angola. Now Mittelafrika has declared war upon us for our colonies, it is time to beat them back and remind them that..."
mittel.10.a:0 "...Angola e Nossa!"
mittel.11.t:0 "The End of the Colonial War"
mittel.11.d:0 "We have been beaten by the Portuguese in Africa, and we wouldn't want to make the situation worse so it would be best if payed them reparations in exchange for peace."
mittel.11.a:0 "Pay reparations in exchange for peace"
mittel.12.t:0 "Mittelafrika Surrenders"
mittel.12.d:0 "The Mittelafrikan government has surrendered, continuation of the war is unrealistic due to fear of German intervention. Angola and Mozambique still belong to us, and the Mittelafrikans are paying us reparations, victory has been achieved!"
mittel.12.a:0 "Hoorah!"
mittel.13.t:0 "Mittelafrika Fails"
mittel.13.d:0 "Mittelafrika has failed to take Angola and Mozambique, and have now been forced into paying reparations for their actions, this is a great embarrassment for Germany, and will make our colony's situation much worse."
mittel.13.a:0 "They are truly an embarrassment"
mittel.15.b:0 "The Kaiser would never forgive us"
mittel.15.t:0 "The End of the Colonial War"
mittel.15.d:0 "We have been beaten by the Germans in Africa, and we wouldn't want to bring the fight home so it would be best if we surrendered our colonies in exchange for peace."

mittel.15.b:0 "Never! Angola e Nossa!"

mittel.17.a:0 "Give the man responsible a raise"
mittel.18.t:0 "Mittelafrika Takes Equatorial Guinea"
mittel.18.d:0 "The German colonial government in Mittelafrika has seized our ex-colony in Equatorial Guinea, one of Syndicalism's holdouts in Africa is gone..."
mittel.18.a:0 "Colonies are exploitative anyway"
mittel.19.t:0 "Skull Roads"
mittel.19.d:0 "Our first project using forced labour could be to build roads using natives from neighbouring villages. This will obviously anger the locals but the infrastructure gained may be invaluable."
mittel.19.a:0 "Implement the plan fully"
mittel.19.b:0 "Implement parts of the plan"
mittel.19.c:0 "Discard the plan"
mittel.20.t:0 "Settlement Cities"
mittel.20.d:0 "Stathalter Göring has been wishing for an expansion of German settlement in Mittelafrika. We can use forced labour to build 'Settlement Cities' for our new colonist citizens. The natives probably won't like it though."
mittel.20.a:0 "Implement the plan fully"
mittel.20.b:0 "Implement parts of the plan"
mittel.20.c:0 "Settlement Cities? That is foolish"
mittel.21.t:0 "Logging Campaigns"
mittel.21.d:0 "A new plan has recently been proposed: Use native forced labour to chop down forests. This would increase our wood production greatly and make us a leading wood producer in the world. At the cost of angering the natives."
mittel.21.a:0 "Implement the plan fully"
mittel.21.b:0 "Implement parts of the plan"
mittel.21.c:0 "This will completely ruin Afrika, do not enact the plan"
mittel.22.t:0 "Kaiser Factories"
mittel.22.d:0 "A minor minister has suggested that we construct armament manufactures directly inside Native villages and use forced labour inside them. He calls the manufactures 'Kaiser Factories'. This would increase our armament production greatly. But the natives would probably not like making guns for their rulers."
mittel.22.a:0 "Implement his plan fully"
mittel.22.b:0 "Implement parts of his plan"
mittel.22.c:0 "Kaiser Factories? What a stupid name"
mittel.23.t:0 "Mining Campaigns"
mittel.23.d:0 "We can massively increase mining in Mittelafrika through use of Forced Labour. This would increase the production of Metals in Mittelafrika. But the conditions inside these mines would probably not make the natives happy."
mittel.23.a:0 "Implement the plan fully"
mittel.23.b:0 "Implement parts of the plan"
mittel.23.c:0 "There is no way that this works"
mittel.24.t:0 "African Revolt!"
mittel.24.d:0 "Due to our abuse of the natives in our Forced Labour programs, they have revolted against our rule! We have sent forces to put them down, but this is still quite a disaster."
mittel.24.a:0 "Oh no!"
mittel.25.t:0 "Mittelafrikan Forced Labour"
mittel.25.d:0 "The Staathalter of Mittelafrika, Herrman Göring has instituted Forced Labour in Mittelafrika, this has caused great suffering in Mittelafrika and has even caused a small revolt. If we let him continue this, he may cause the collapse of Mittelafrika. What should we do?"
mittel.25.a:0 "Demand that he stop"
mittel.25.b:0 "We can trust Göring with Mittelafrika"
mittel.26.t:0 "The Kaiser asks us to stop"
mittel.26.d:0 "We have recieved a message from Berlin: Stop Forced Labour. As we are a colonial government we should probably hede the Kaiser's word. But after all Göring has the final decision in Mittelafrika..."
mittel.26.a:0 "Perhaps we can try our luck..."
mittel.27.t:0 "Colonists Arrive"
mittel.27.d:0 "A new batch of immigrants and colonists from Germany and Mitteleuropa have arrived, most of them are settling in the East coast of Africa, but there are a few brave adventurers looking elsewhere"
