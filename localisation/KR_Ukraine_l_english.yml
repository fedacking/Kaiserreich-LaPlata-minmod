### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with the help of Germany on 25 January 1918. Yet still the national situation is unstable. Germany makes us sell our goods only to its allies, ethnic Russians and pro-Russian population dream of the unification with Russia, Syndicalists gain popularity in the biggest cities, while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that Ukraine should be only for the Ukrainians and that our Kingdom is no more than a mere German puppet."
ukraine.1.a:0 "Fascinating."
ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d:0 "Even our government is divided and Pavel Skoropadsky does his best to solve the antagonisms between the army, which consists in general of the former officers of the Russian Imperial Army and other Ukrainian ministers, who support our current position in Mitteleuropa. All these problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the farmers and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their agricultural products in Europe."
ukraine.2.a:0 "Don't provoke the peasants."
ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking..."
ukraine.3.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its grain trade with the German Empire to maintain its economic security. However, the current economic and social troubles have meant that the Germans are now more interested in protecting their own farmers than subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us - without money from German trade, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their position in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe. Right?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis different pro-Russian movements were rather weak and didn't pose much of a threat to our government. But this crisis led to the growth of these organisations. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev Mikhail Bulgakov proclaimed the unification of the 3 biggest movements into 1, called 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Church, population of the Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many officers, this movement could provoke instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a:0 "We really must protest!"
ukraine.6.t:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky returns from Africa"
ukraine.6.d:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, returns to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which helped our German allies in Mittelafrika. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky was promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack division ('Serdyutskaya' division), which belongs to the elite of the Ukrainian army."
ukraine.6.a:0 "Welcome home!"
ukraine.7.t:0 "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmitri Dontsov, an ideologist of Ukrainian nationalism has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the Ukrainians to fight against the pro-Polish government. Now he claims that the crisis exposed the weakness of our government and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by the real Ukrainian patriots. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine. This could be dangerous for the cabinet since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a:0 "Em...Welcome home..."
ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev Criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social-democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government uses extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty. To further this he has proposed a new programme of social reforms, which should help Ukraine overcome this crisis. He is going to present his plan in the Rada."
ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? Hmm... sounds like BOLSHEVISM!"
ukraine.9.t:0 "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered an Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, the loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, the pro-Russian forces and the Nationalists claims the radical measures and the Syndicalists mobilises their supporters all over the country. Various political movements struggle for the power in the country and we have to choose, who will lead Ukraine to the future."
ukraine.9.a:0 "Ukraine has not yet died!"
ukraine.10.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few Social Democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an extremely powerful influence over the Ukrainian peasantry. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has called openly for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them dangerous ideas. But maybe we can use Khrushchev and allow him to start some unpopular among the landlords reforms in the economy, which we must do anyway."
ukraine.10.a:0 "Dismiss Skoropadsky and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has headed the government during the strongest crisis since 1918. But before improving the economic problems, Nikita Khrushchev has to do something about the pro-Russian movements, which try to influence our electorate in the most industrial-developed parts of Ukraine. One of the biggest domestic problems existing in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto the Russian language is used by majority of the population, but the usage is prohibited in the state institutions."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b:0 "Arrest the pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky oppose Khrushchev's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in the state institutions. They claim that this decision won't unify our country and that free usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in the Southern and Eastern Ukrainian regions."
ukraine.12.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo"
ukraine.13.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d:0 "Unfortunately leaders of the different pro-Russian movements escaped from Ukraine. Mikhail Bulgakov announced, that 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of the Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a:0 "Another problem!"
ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the 'Kulaks' and to spend this money on the poorest peasants led to stabilisation of our agriculture. 60-70% of the state and private farms are now self-supporting. As a result we can solve other, more difficult problems in our economy, because we have support in the villages and farms."
ukraine.14.a:0 "That's great."
ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation ended in a total failure, the situation in Ukraine is even worse than before!"
ukraine.15.a:0 "Syndicalism doesn't always work"
ukraine.16.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d:0 "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvaniy gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary forces sweeping the country. Now that Khrushchev's initial program has been implemented, many interest groups within Ukraine are asking for Royal Power to intervene to create a more sustainable order."
ukraine.16.a:0 "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government"
ukraine.16.b:0 "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.17.t:0 "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d:0 "Igor Kistyakovsky, who has been our minister of Security since 1918, had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian nationalists' started immediately to fight for this top position in the government because each party hopes to control Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to our agreement, which were concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a:0 "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b:0 "Vladimir Chekhovsky from 'OUN'"
ukraine.17.c:0 "Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman"
ukraine.18.t:0 "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d:0 "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct their economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This free trade area would also be a boon for our own merchants and industrialists, opening the largely agrarian Ukrainian market for their goods."
ukraine.18.a:0 "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a:0 "Great"
ukraine.20.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d:0 "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.20.a:0 "Great"
ukraine.21.t:0 "Prosvita is Effective!"
ukraine.21.d:0 "Activity of the Prosvita movement has had a positive influence on our youth. A lot of the young people are ready to defend their country, their culture and traditions. They will be perfect soldiers of our army."
ukraine.21.a:0 "That's right young man, enrol in the army!"
ukraine.22.t:0 "Regional languages"
ukraine.22.d:0 "Though Skoropadsky didn't recognise the Russian language as the second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose, which languages they would use. Now, when the majority of our regions stated the role of the Russian language as the second official language, Skoropadsky finally ready to give it the same position in the whole Ukraine."
ukraine.22.a:0 "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"
ukraine.23.t:0 "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan, which they want to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. The situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help our ally."
ukraine.23.a:0 "Very well grant them the money"
ukraine.23.b:0 "Who cares?"
ukraine.24.t:0 "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine. It is, after all, a much better place to invest than Eastern Poland!"
ukraine.24.a:0 "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.25.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d:0 "Our government could finally electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Ukraine has finally begun to recover from Black Monday."
ukraine.25.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.26.t:0 "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.26.d:0 "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.26.a:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
ukraine.26.b:0 "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."
ukraine.27.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Ukraine has started to recover from Black Monday."
ukraine.27.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.28.t:0 "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine. But the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Will we help our ally?"
ukraine.28.a:0 "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.28.b:0 "There is a crisis in Germany, you know"
ukraine.29.t:0 "Germany Has Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.29.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the syndicalist movements there."
ukraine.29.a:0 "Very well"
ukraine.30.t:0 "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine Complete"
ukraine.30.d:0 "The workers of Eastern Ukraine have got new workplaces. As a result a majority of the population has become loyal to us. We have recovered from Black Monday and defeated all the syndicalist trade unions in the East!"
ukraine.30.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.31.t:0 "Germany Has Declined To Grant Us a Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d:0 "Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.31.a:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to increase taxes."
ukraine.31.b:0 "Too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t:0 "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine is Complete"
ukraine.32.d:0 "The workers of Eastern Ukraine have got new workplaces. As a result a majority of the population has become loyal to us. We have recovered from Black Monday and defeated all the syndicalist trade unions in the East!"
ukraine.32.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.33.t:0 "Ukraine asks for help!"
ukraine.33.d:0 "Ukraine, a new syndicalist nation in the Eastern Europe led by Nikita Khrushchev asks our help since they can't start the reform in their industry alone. There are some plans which were proposed by our ministry of economy - which one will we choose?"
ukraine.33.a:0 "Time to help their military industry!"
ukraine.33.b:0 "Let's build a brewing facility in their capital!"
ukraine.33.c:0 "They can do everything without us."
ukraine.34.t:0 "What should we do with Ukraine?"
ukraine.34.d:0 "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted our alliance! Many hotheads in the general staff suggest military action to punish the Ukraine, however, doing so would be extremely unwise as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe. Instead members of the Abwehr suggest that we use our ties with many important members of the Ukrainian armed forces to instigate a coup. How shall we react to this betrayal?"
ukraine.34.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.34.b:0 "Covert operations will be good enough."
ukraine.34.c:0 "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"
ukraine.35.t:0 "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d:0 "Following our decision to leave the hated Mitteleuropa System, the German military mission present in country since 1918 finally left!"
ukraine.35.a:0 "Finally they leave!"
ukraine.36.t:0 "'Arsenal'"
ukraine.36.d:0 "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kiev organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine. Since then the government didn't try to expand the factory, fearing the temper of its workers. But after the triumph of the Syndicalism in Ukraine, the French government decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns."
ukraine.36.a:0 "That's great!"
ukraine.37.t:0 "Ukraine Wants to Join the International"
ukraine.37.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine has announced recently that they want to join the Syndicalist bloc. It's not a sudden move because pro-Syndicalist policy is popular in many circles including the government and army. Do we want Ukrainian workers and peasants joining the crusade against bloodthirsty Germans and rotten imperialist Canadian pigs?"
ukraine.37.a:0 "Yes! We shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b:0 "Rather not."
ukraine.38.t:0 "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d:0 "The French and British are happy to see us joining the common cause - destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are part of the Syndicalist bloc."
ukraine.38.a:0 "This time we will win!"
ukraine.39.t:0 "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d:0 "German agitators with the help of reactionary officers and a part of the armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. The country is in chaos, how will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a:0 "The reactionary putschists secure the capital!"
ukraine.39.b:0 "Red militias defend the capital!"
ukraine.40.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine"
ukraine.40.d:0 "Members of German military mission together with parts of the Ukrainian armed forces have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Ukrainian Socialist government and replacing it with one loyal to the German Empire. We have once again secured Ukraine as a member of Mitteleuropa and prevented the expansion of Syndicalist influence!"
ukraine.40.a:0 "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
ukraine.41.d:0 "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. What shall we do now?"
ukraine.41.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.41.b:0 "War will solve this!"
ukraine.42.t:0 "'Obolon'"
ukraine.42.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev knows that the workers and peasants of Ukraine deserve a chance for a better and joy life, that's why he always pays serious attention to the needs of the ordinary people. The French government proposed us a good idea how to make the live in Ukraine better - the Commune will invest in the largest brewing facility in Europe, which will produce beer for our people. The factory, which were named 'Obolon' will definitely give us some support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society."
ukraine.42.a:0 "Excellent!"
ukraine.43.t:0 "No support from France!"
ukraine.43.d:0 "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us...at least right now. But we have to be persistent and hope that we will improve our relations with the strongest syndicalist nations in the world!"
ukraine.43.a:0 "Let's hope they won't forget us at all."
ukraine.44.t:0 "Claiming Bessarabia"
ukraine.44.d:0 "Bessarabia was occupied by Romanian Forces on 27 march 1918. We couldn't do nothing, but now we have to revive its foreign policy, Since the current international situation is favourable for us, we should claim Bessarabia and retake it from Romania."
ukraine.44.a:0 "Insist on returning of Bessarabia"
ukraine.44.b:0 "Insist on returning of Bessarabia"
ukraine.45.t:0 "Ukrainian demands"
ukraine.45.d:0 "Yesterday Ukrainian government demanded the return of Bessarabia region. If we agree with Ukrainian claims, we will lost 1/3 of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate invasion of our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these awful claims of Ukrainian leadership?"
ukraine.45.a:0 "Accept their terms"
ukraine.45.b:0 "Never!"
ukraine.46.t:0 "Iron Guard Romania refuses!"
ukraine.46.d:0 "Romanian government published a note, where insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Ukraine will never get this land. The only solution of this problem for us is the war with Romanian Legionaries."
ukraine.46.a:0 "Then it is war"
ukraine.46.b:0 "We don't need Bessarabia"
ukraine.47.t:0 "Ukrainian demands"
ukraine.47.d:0 "Yesterday Ukrainian government demanded the return of Bessarabia region. If we agree with Ukrainian claims, we will lost 1/3 of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate invasion of our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these awful claims of Ukrainian leadership?"
ukraine.47.a:0 "Accept their terms"
ukraine.47.b:0 "Never!"
ukraine.48.t:0 "Romania refuses!
ukraine.48.d:0 "Romanian King published a note, where he insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Ukraine will never get this region. The only solution of this problem for us is the war with Romanian Monarchists"
ukraine.48.a:0 "Then it is war"
ukraine.48.b:0 "We don't need Bessarabia"
ukraine.49.t:0 "Social Chaos in the Ukraine!"
ukraine.49.d:0 "Distressing news - conditions in the countryside have driven our peasants into radicalism! They are expropriating the estates of absentee proprietors for themselves, and there are even cases of resident landlords being lynched. Law and order has broken down, and the King is burned in effigy! Worse, our urban workers are rallying behind the cause, and there are daily demonstrations on the streets of Kiev calling for a Ukrainian Social Republic!"
ukraine.49.a:0 "This is the final struggle!"
ukraine.52.t:0 "An Heir to King Vasily?"
ukraine.52.d:0 "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such he has to choose his successor. Only two candidatures are considered by the government and ministers - the nephew of Vasily, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman.
