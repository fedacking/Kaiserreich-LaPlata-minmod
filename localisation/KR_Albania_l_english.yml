albania.1.t:0 "The Albanian Principality"
albania.1.d:0 "During the First Balkans War in 1912 the Albanian national congress in Vlore declared the country's independence which was accepted by the major powers in 1913 upon the condition that Wilhelms of Wied would be accepted as Prince. The outbreak of the Weltkrieg presented more problems for the country as Austria-Hungary demanded Albanian soldiers to fight alongside them. When Prince Wilhelm refused, citing the neutrality of Albania in the Treaty of London, the remuneration that he had been receiving was cut off. His regime collapsed and Prince Wilhelm left the country on September 3 1914 and joined the Imperial German Army, even if formally he still was the Albanian Head Of State. On 1921, the Peace with Honour officially determined the status of Albania; a restored principality under the authority of the Prince Wilhelm, not under Austrian influence anymore, but as a formal vassal of the Ottoman caliph. Even if revolts started to break out, Prince Wilhelm was able to regain control of the country thanks to the Ottoman support. However, the price he had to pay was the Ottoman control over the country's inner politics, such as forcing the Prince to appoint the very ambitious Ahmed Zogu as his Prime Minister."

albania.2.t:0 "Fate of Albania"
albania.2.d:0 "For many years, the Ottomans have ruled over us in an uneasy agreement with Germany to have Wilhelm on the throne. Today, problems have arisen for the Ottomans, and Zog wishes to claim the throne once and for all and establish a Free Albania."

albania.3.t:0 "Wilhelm of Albania overthrown!"
albania.3.d:0 "For many years, we have ruled over Albania in an uneasy agreement with Germany to have Wilhelm on the throne. Today, the Albanian Zog has overthrown Wilhelm in a coup. How should we react to this mess?"

albania.4.t:0 "Albanian uprising successful!"
albania.4.d:0 "The Albanian forces led by Ahmed Zogu, who arrogantly styles himself King Zog I, have assumed control of Albania. Our garrisons have been taken prisoner, and some of our generals warn that trying to recapture our former vilayet would result in much bloodshed for little gain. Shall we recognise the independence of Albania?"
albania.4.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
albania.4.b:0 "Never!"

albania.5.t:0 "The Albanian Campaign is Over"
