### Events ###
cuba.1.t:0 "Syndicalism spreading in America!"
cuba.1.d:0 "The increasing power of the Combined Syndicates of America has been of great concern to the Cuban government. President Vinageras fears now that the CSA controls large parts of the former USA's south and east, Cuba will soon be threatened by the godless Syndicalists. With the USA shattered, our nation needs to look for new allies."
cuba.1.a:0 "Only Canada can protect us from the Syndicalists!"
cuba.1.b:0 "Cuba can protect itself!"

cuba.2.t:0 "Cuba asks for protection"
cuba.2.d:0 "The increasing power of the Combined Syndicates of America has been of great concern to the Cuban government. President Vinageras fears that, now that the CSA control large parts of the former USA's south and east, Cuba will soon be threatened by the godless Syndicalists. With the USA shattered, Cuba pleads for our protection."

cuba.4.t:0 "Join the Caribbean Federation?"
cuba.4.d:0 "The Canadian government has offered us to join the Entente, but we are required to become part of the Caribbean Federation.

cuba.4.b:0 "We have no choice, we can't fight the Reds on our own..."

cuba.5.t:0 "Cuban Ministers in our Government?"
cuba.5.d:0 "Cuba has petitioned to join our Federation, but demands fair political representation in our government. Considering that Cuba's population is as large as the entire Federation's, the request seems reasonable. But some of our ministers fear that that Cubans will dominate our government and the Federation."
cuba.5.a:0 "The request is reasonable. Invite Cuban officials into our government"
cuba.5.b:0 "No, they will wait for an election"

cuba.6.t:0 "The Caribbean Federation Denied our Request"

cuba.8.t:0 "Cuba joins the Caribbean Federation"

cuba.10.a:0 "English will stay the official Language of the Federation"
cuba.10.b:0 "The federal government will be multilingual!"

cuba.11.t:0 "A free Cuba?"

cuba.25.t:0 "Attack on Fort Moncada"
cuba.25.d:0 "The Army attack on unarmed protesters in Havana only served to fuel dissent against the State and give more sympathisers to the syndicalist cause.
