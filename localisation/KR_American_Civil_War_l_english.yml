amcivwar.421.t:0 "Fort Sumter under shelling"
amcivwar.421.d:0 "For the second time in the history of our nation, Fort Sumter in South Carolina has come under shelling by insurrectionist artillery. Our garrison is frantically radioing us, asking for a fleet detachment to sail down there and pick them up.\n\nThis would be a highly risky task, but could land us an incredible propaganda coup - and also a few highly needed additional troops. What should we do?"
amcivwar.421.a:0 "Let's try it!"
amcivwar.421.b:0 "Our hands are bound."
amcivwar.422.t:0 "The US sends relief to Fort Sumter"
amcivwar.422.d:0 "We currently have most of Charleston under our control - apart from Fort Sumter, which was only recently re-built. According to the latest intel, the US are sending a small naval squadron to evacuate their troops! This squadron will not be able to threaten our position in Charleston; Their only goal will be to get their allies out of the Fort.\n\nWe could now either rally an im-promptu blockade to hold the siege against the naval reinforcements or hope that our artillery currently present will be enough. What shall we do?"
amcivwar.422.a:0 "Rally more boats!"
amcivwar.422.b:0 "Let them come!"
amcivwar.423.t:0 "The Second Battle of Fort Sumter"
amcivwar.423.d:0 "After hasty preparations, the US squadron has come into view behind Fort Sumter while the loyalists pinned inside the Fort are trying to break out! Our commanders are confident they can put up with the two-pronged attack..."
amcivwar.423.a:0 "Let's hope for the best..."
amcivwar.424.t:0 "Fort Sumter raid successful"
amcivwar.424.d:0 "Success! Our small squadron was able to slip into Charleston harbour before insurgent naval forces could be mobilised, and even though they took losses from artillery shelling, they were able to link up with the loyalists after their successful breakout! \n\nThe commander of the naval squadron and many of the evacuees, who fought tooth and nail against the Syndicalists, are being honoured as heroes!"
amcivwar.424.a:0 "Incredible!"
amcivwar.425.t:0 "The Fort Sumter Hellgate"
amcivwar.425.d:0 "Success! Our militia commanders successfully exploited the vulnerability of the US squadron, holding their artillery fire until the ships had laid anchor beside the fort to take on the evacuees! Fort Sumter was completely destroyed in the ensuing shelling, and so was most of the squadron - our river boat flotilla could only pick up a few dozen survivors afterwards.\n\nThe militia commander is being honoured as a hero!"
amcivwar.425.a:0 "Incredible!"
amcivwar.426.t:0 "The Fort Sumter Hellgate"
amcivwar.426.d:0 "Failure! Our small squadron was able to slip into Charleston harbour, only to be lit up by an incredible artillery barrage apparently out of nowhere! Our info - coming from the Fort Sumter radio station - is thin, but it seems that after the squadron had been obliterated, the few survivors in Fort Sumter itself surrendered as well.\n\nThe squadron commander would now be facing a trial for his sever failures - if he was still alive, that is."
amcivwar.426.a:0 "Damn it!"
amcivwar.427.t:0 "Fort Sumter siege failed"
amcivwar.427.d:0 "Failure! Our artillery was unable to hold back the small US squadron from evacuating the counter-revolutionaries. Even though losses were minimal, this is still a blow to the prestige of the Union State! \n\nThe commander of our militia forces will face a tribunal for his failures shortly."
amcivwar.427.a:0 "Damn it!"

amcivwar.500.t:0 "Fate of the Unions"
amcivwar.500.d:0 "With the civil war now over, it is time to decide the fate of the Labour Unions. Most of the Labour Unions were part of the Combined Syndicates of America Federation and took up arms with the outbreak of the conflict. More conservative elements are wanting us to ban them as a punishment for taking up arms while others are advocating clemency as a way to rebuild America."
amcivwar.500.a:0 "Allow the Unions"
amcivwar.500.b:0 "Ban the Unions"
