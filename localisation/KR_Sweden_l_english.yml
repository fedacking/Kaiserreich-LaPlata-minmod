### Ideas ###

### Senpai's Reformation ###

SWE_SENREF_:0 "-"

SWE_SENREF_revolution:0 "Disorderly Revolution"
SWE_SENREF_revolution_desc:0 "The recent far-left revolution has left the country in chaos. Rival factions are fighting for political dominance as the government machine is all but crippled."
SWE_SENREF_economicstandstill:0 "Economic Standstill"
SWE_SENREF_economicstandstill_desc:0 "While the party higher-ups are reinventing the economy as we know it, the stock market is tumbling and the factories have ground to a halt."
SWE_SENREF_noarmy:0 "Dissolved Army"
SWE_SENREF_noarmy_desc:0 "The military is being remade from scratch. While we are sure that this will lead to great things in the future, the reality remains that we currently have no army."
SWE_SENREF_taxhike:0 "Increased Taxation"
SWE_SENREF_taxhike_desc:0 "While our recent tax hikes might hurt the economy in the short run, they will fund the most important projects our country has ever undertaken."

SWE_SENREF_taxcuts:0 "Tax Cuts"
SWE_SENREF_taxcuts_desc:0 "The recent tax cuts have done much to get the economy going, but the dip in public funds have led to a number of necessary downsizes of the public sector."

SWE_SENREF_indoctrination:0 "Indoctrination"
SWE_SENREF_indoctrination_desc:0 "Our citizens are being raised up to be efficient killing machines of the state. This comes at the expense of free thought, and innovation is slowing down. This is, of course, a small trade-off that we have to pay in order to get a top-quality army."
SWE_SENREF_fanaticism:0 "Fanatic Nationalism"
SWE_SENREF_fanaticism_desc:0 "Each and every one of our citizens will happily give their lives for our country."
SWE_SENREF_industrial_statare:0 "Corporate Work Camps"
SWE_SENREF_industrial_statare_desc:0 "Statare are now allowed to be employed by corporations.

While not quite slavery, critics say that this is about as close as it gets."
SWE_SENREF_freemedia:0 "Free Press"
SWE_SENREF_freemedia_desc:0 "The state grip on television and radio broadcasting has been done with and free thought and diverse ideas are spreading across the nation, for good and bad."

SWE_contentious_elections:0 "Contentious election"
SWE_contentious_elections_desc:0 "This last campaign has been unusually contentious and both sides warn that should the other side win, it will be the end of Sweden. It strains our society greatly and there is word of syndicalist coup plans and military take-overs. God protect Sweden."
SWE_statare:0 "Statare"
SWE_statare_desc:0 "A 'Statare' is a farm-worker with poor legal protection and limited rights, finding themselves paid in kind such such as potatoes and flour rather than money.

SWE_redrule2:0 "Revolutionary Renewal"
SWE_redrule2_desc:0 "In addition to the issues with educating our people to see things in a different way, dismantling our entire economy over night had some unforeseen negative effects. Who would've thought?"
SWE_redrule3:0 "Revolutionary Revision"
SWE_redrule3_desc:0 "With our society in uproar and our economy staggering to survive, our proposed military reforms are met with suspicion from officers and privates alike. They will see the light soon enough... Hopefully."
SWE_redrule4:0 "Revolutionary Transformation"
SWE_redrule4_desc:0 "With massive education programs, a weak economy and a spiteful military we have no choice but to take the next great leap forward. The sooner, the better!"

SWE_radicalistmilitary:0 "Radical Socialist Military"

SWE_radicalistsociety:0 "Radical Socialist politics"
SWE_radicalistsociety_desc:0 "In our socialist society, people organise in strong unions which in turn represent them and their needs. Their chance to influence them is strong enough for people to feel like they are part of something important."
SWE_radicalistpeople:0 "Radical Socialist People"
SWE_radicalistpeople_desc:0 "The people of our nation feel encouraged, knowing that no matter what ills befall them, the state will be there to protect them, in sickness and in health."

SWE_totalistmilitary:0 "Totalist Military"
SWE_totalistmilitary_desc:0 "The Totalist Military would remind the onlooker very much of any traditional, imperialist army, with a strict hierarchy and a focus on offensive campaigns. At least they call their sergeants Comrade Sergeant."
SWE_totalisteconomy:0 "Totalist Economy"
SWE_totalisteconomy_desc:0 "The current economy is designed to support grand projects initiated by the state, in particular in the military, and the power is more or less completely centralised to the authorities of the capital."

SWE_syndicalisteconomy:0 "Syndicalist Economy"

SWE_germ_swe_trade:0 "German-Swedish Steel Treaty"
SWE_germ_swe_trade_desc:0 "The German-Swedish Steel Treaty assures that Sweden and Germany will remain trading partners for a long time to come. More importantly, German experts was sent to Sweden to help us improve our mining industry, and they are more efficient than they have ever been!"
SWE_nordic_bloctrade:0 "The Nordic Bloc"
SWE_nordic_bloctrade_desc:0 "The Nordic Bloc is now considered a single, inner market, without toll limitations and with easy access in between the participating nations. This reform has been rewarding economically, but even more in terms of popularity. Finally, the Fraternal people's are truly on brotherly terms!"

SWE_reformed_statare:0 "Reformed Statare"
SWE_reformed_statarere_desc:0 "With a major overhaul work done with the Statar-situation on the countryside we can finally reap the benefits from our hard labour. Statarna now get paid both in kind and in wages and they are guaranteed the right to decent homes near their work-place and representatives in local administrations."
SWE_corporate_statare:0 "Corporate Statare"
SWE_corporate_statare_desc:0 "We have optimised the system with our Statare, making sure they aren't eligible only to farms and countryside companies but also to the state. A strengthened police force keeps dissent at bay as there is still discontent due to lack of proper pay and housing."

SWE_new_rule_natpo_desc:0 "With the Swedish flag flying high on every street in Sweden, there's no doubt that the unlikely candidate of Martin Ekström has managed to claim a steady grip of Sweden.

SWE_gothenburg_officers:0 "Göteborg Navy School"
SWE_gothenburg_officers_desc:0 "The Navy School of Göteborg proclaims that at sea, wars will be won in large, decisive engagements. These engagements can only be one if we bring superior firepower, not only in ships but also in naval bombers to support those ships."
SWE_karlskrona_officers:0 "Karlskrona Navy School"
SWE_karlskrona_officers_desc:0 "The Navy School of Karlskrona teaches us that at sea, wars will not be one in large battles. Rather, we should focus our industry and tactics on harassing enemy shipping lines while protecting our own trading industry. We will win by starving our enemy out."

SWE_neutral:0 "Swedish Neutrality"
SWE_neutral_desc:0 "The policy of Swedish neutrality dates back for almost a century and a half. It has kept us out of war because we have openly declared our intent to not pick a side. Some would call us cowards, but once the dust settles we'll have gone through it unscathed."
SWE_svensktiger:0 "En Svensk Tiger"
SWE_svensktiger_desc:0 "The policy of Swedish neutrality dates back for almost a century and a half. It has kept us out of war because we have openly declared our intent to not pick a side. Some would call us cowards, but once the dust settles we'll have gone through it unscathed. At the same time, we must remain wary that hostile agents do not try and influence one side or the other, the Swedish tiger must stand vigilant!"
SWE_gransen:0 "Håll gränsen!"
SWE_gransen_desc:0 "The policy of Swedish neutrality dates back for almost a century and a half. It has kept us out of war because we have openly declared our intent to not pick a side. Some would call us cowards, but once the dust settles we'll have gone through it unscathed. The policy will, in the end, mean nothing if someone declares a war on us either way though, and as such our troops must be capable of holding the border, 'Håll gränsen!'."

SWE_labor_division:0 "Work Brigades"
SWE_labor_division_desc:0 "We should establish civilian work-brigades for those men who aren't fit enough to serve in our armed forces. They can serve our military too, but instead of rifles they'll use shovels."
SWE_defensive_armies:0 "Defensive Warfare"
SWE_defensive_armies_desc:0 "Our generals have been instructed to prepare our soldiers for a defensive type of warfare, with a focus of holding our borders and, should we lose any ground to the enemy, to quickly retake it."
SWE_defensive_armies_thor:0 "Hemvärnet"
SWE_defensive_armies_thor_desc:0 "Landstormen was considered outdated and was replaced by the brainchild of Olof Thörnell, Hemvärnet (Home guard). Instead of being made up solely of elder, formerly conscripted men, Hemvärnet is made up of civilians of eligiable age who meet up and train during their spare time. This provides us with a large group of people for a quick draft, should we need it, and increases the general quality of our troops."
SWE_defensive_armies_nygr:0 "Extensive Staff Planning"
SWE_defensive_armies_nygr_desc:0 "With Oscar Nygren at the helm Sweden's High command has almost tripled in size, with alternative plans being drawn up, prepared, reworked and scrapped time and time again. It seems like there's not a single situation that they aren't prepared for!"

SWE_offensive_armies:0 "Offensive Warfare"
SWE_offensive_armies_desc:0 "Our generals have been instructed to prepare our soldiers for an offensive type of warfare, with a focus of doing a majority of the fighting outside of Sweden's borders, to protect our homeland from the ravages of war."
SWE_auftaktik_rappe:0 "Overwhelming Artillery"
SWE_auftaktik_rappe_desc:0 "With Axel Rappe's theories of overwhelming firepower dominating the officer corps of Sweden from the lowliest NGO to the very chief of staff himself, we have learned to perfect the art of artillery coordination. From a safe distance of enemy lines our artillery shall turn our enemies to dust before attacking."
SWE_auftaktik_arch:0 "Armoured Spearhead"
SWE_auftaktik_arch_desc:0 "The armoured spearhead relies strongly on the idea of using quick, motorised units supported by tanks to punch holes into enemy lines and encircle them. Traditional infantry units can then be used to clean up the pockets left behind by the encirclement. With Archibald Douglas at the helm, this will be our new bread and butter."

SWE_bef_taktik:0 "Befehlstaktik"
SWE_bef_taktik_desc:0 "In Befehlstaktik the military commander gives subordinate leaders a clearly defined goal and the methods to achieve said goal. The subordinate leaders are not given much room from improvisation in the field, as following your commander's plans are key for the success of the operation as a whole. The strength of Befehlstaktik lies in the ability for a highly skilled commander to execute a multilayered plan, knowing when what happens. The flaw of the system lies in its lack of flexibility, as a commander who improvises due to change of circumstances could in theory be court-martialed for disobeying orders."
SWE_auftaktik:0 "Auftragstaktik"
SWE_auftaktik_desc:0 "In Auftragstaktik the military commander gives subordinate leaders a clearly defined goal (the mission), the forces needed to accomplish that goal and a time frame within which the goal must be reached. The subordinate leaders then implement the order independently. The subordinate leader is given, to a large extent, the planning initiative and a freedom in execution which allows a high degree of flexibility at the Operational and Tactical levels of command. As such, it encourages commanders to exhibit initiative, flexibility and improvisation while in command. In what may be seen as surprising to some, Auftragstaktik empowers commanders to disobey orders and revise their effect as long as the intent of the commander is maintained. The greatest weakness lies in that if the lower ranking leaders aren't well trained, it is an extremely dangerous tactic to employ."

SWE_lottorna11:0 "Lottakåren"
SWE_lottorna11_desc:0 "Lottorna now stand able and ready to serve the Swedish state and army in the best way. For now, these duties include assisting our medical staff, cooking and preparing food, repairing clothes and tasks of that nature."
SWE_lottorna_aux1:0 "Auxiliary Lottakår"
SWE_lottorna_aux1_desc:0 "Lottorna now stand able and ready to serve the Swedish state and army in the best way. With their auxiliary duties expanded upon, they hold many non-combat positions in our army, working in areas such as transport, the signal corps, non-combat engineers and in administration."
SWE_lottorna_mil1:0 "Militarized Lottakår"
SWE_lottorna_mil1_desc:0 "Lottorna now stand able and ready to serve the Swedish state and army in the best way. With a full militarisation Lottakåren has more or less been fully integrated into the army and several of our units are gender-mixed. There are a couple air-force female-only brigades, however, called Valkyriorna."

SWE_air_production:0 "Swedish Fighter Investments"
SWE_air_production_desc:0 "A massive industrial effort has been made to safeguard Swedish air dominance for years to come. Our industry is now geared for mass production."

SWE_upplund:0 "Uppsala and Lund Universities"
SWE_upplund_desc:0 "The Uppsala and Lund Universities are among the finest in Europe and thanks to our recent investments and encouragement of friendly competition in between the organisations their efficiency has increased even further. With new thoughts and ideas sprouting from the bright minds of our nation on a daily basis, it's no wonder our technological advancements follow suit."

SWE_black_monday:0 "Swedish Black Monday"
SWE_black_monday_desc:0 "With our economy battered thanks to the economic meltdown in Germany, our most important trading partner, it'll take extensive industrial reforms to restore our nation."

### Focuses ###

### Senpai's Reformation ###

SWE_SENREF_POLCOMMON:0 "Form a New Government"
SWE_SENREF_POLCOMMON_desc:0 "Our country has had it rough, but when the dust settles someone has to form a new government. Whether we go left or right, many agree that things will never be the same again."
SWE_SENREF_LEFT1:0 "Serve the Worker"
SWE_SENREF_LEFT1_desc:0 "The conservatives have ruled this country for a long time, but no more! We will no longer bow down to an unjust system that places all the wealth and power in the hands of the few. We have to set the agenda to benefit the common man."
SWE_SENREF_RIGHT1:0 "Support Enterprise"
SWE_SENREF_RIGHT1_desc:0 "Right-wing politics have made this country strong, and it can make it even stronger! Unskilled labourers are by no means competent enough to steer this country in the right direction. Quality before equality, that's just the way it is."
SWE_SENREF_AUTHLEFT:0 "Revolution"
SWE_SENREF_AUTHLEFT_desc:0 "Enough fooling around. The Market Economy is just a tool for the few to leech wealth out of the hard work of the many. A system that is meant to stack all the cards in favour of the strong at the cost of the well-being of the weak is rotten to the core. Tear it all down."
SWE_SENREF_LIBLEFT:0 "Reform"
SWE_SENREF_LIBLEFT_desc:0 "The Market Economy has the potential to produce a lot of wealth. It is not the system itself that is flawed, it is where the money goes. The benefits of a capitalist economy can be reaped by everyone if we just share the wealth around. There is plenty of money in the system, we must use it for the good of the people."
SWE_SENREF_LIBRIGHT:0 "Property Rights"
SWE_SENREF_LIBRIGHT_desc:0 "Private property is sacred. Every home is a castle and every man is a king. The government has no business in stealing the hard-earned assets of it's citizens. The government is there to serve it's people, not the other way around. Don't tread on me."
SWE_SENREF_AUTHRIGHT:0 "The Greater Good"
SWE_SENREF_AUTHRIGHT_desc:0 "We are all part of the same people and we have a responsibility to take care of each other. We should encourage cooperation instead of competition. Because people cannot be trusted to make sacrifices voluntarily, there has to be rule of law. All for the greater good of the nation."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL:0 "Abolish the Monarchy"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL_desc:0 "It is time to end this outdated form of institutional oppression. We are all born equal, plain and simple."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL1:0 "The Economic Revolution"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL1_desc:0 "We have been talking about it for a long time, but today is the day when we seize the means of production away from the oligarchs and aristocrats and give it to the workers. The only question is, how will we do this?"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL1_tooltip:0 "§GYou will set the economic agenda of the new government.§! \n"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL2:0 "An Egalitarian Society"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL2_desc:0 "We must overhaul the bureaucracy of the country, make new laws and amend existing ones. Our people will be reborn, although our government is plagued with disagreements..."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL2_tooltip:0 "§GYou will set the social agenda of the new government.§! \n"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL3:0 "Purge the Army"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL3_desc:0 "The military is full of reactionaries and aristocrats. We cannot entrust the defence of the people to these right-wing lunatics. We must tear down our corrupt military and build it anew."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL3_tooltip:0 "§GYou will set the military agenda of the new government.§! \n"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL4:0 "Cultural Revolution"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL4_desc:0 "Our people need to be educated with the right principles and values. Once again a debate plagues our government regarding what the right values are..."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL4_tooltip:0 "§GYou will set the cultural agenda of the new government.§! \n"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL5:0 "Support the World Revolution"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL5_desc:0 "Socialism transcends national borders, we are all part of the same world after all. We must ally ourselves with those that are like-minded abd fight for the greater good - together."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL6:0 "Unite the Government"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL6_desc:0 "Now that we have a clear idea of what our society should be like, it is time to finally form a new government. Our nation have been through troublesome times, but a brighter future is on the horizon. Glory to the revolution."
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL6_tooltip:0 "§GA new government will be formed based on your previous choices.§! \n"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL7:0 "The New Sweden"
SWE_SENREF_RADICAL7_desc:0 "As we leave our dark past behind us it is time to seize the future. Together we will shape a better tomorrow, as brothers and sisters of the revolution. This is it. The New Sweden."
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM:0 "Increase Taxation"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM_desc:0 "We should increase taxes, particularly on the wealthy. Those that are wealthy enough should foot the bill when thousands of people are hungry, sick and homeless. At the end of the day we have to ask ourselves what is more important, a stacked bank account or that children do not go hungry?"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM1:0 "Universal Healthcare"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM1_desc:0 "Money should not be the difference between life and death! Social status should never determine the right to survive and therefore all healthcare must be free and equal."
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM2:0 "Public Education"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM2_desc:0 "Everyone should have the right to get a proper education. Social mobility must be our first priority in creating our new society. After all, a literate and educated population benefits us all."
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM3:0 "Elderly Care"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM3_desc:0 "We cannot forget the well-being of those that built this country. Generous pensions and institutions that tend to the needs of the elderly will make sure that nobody is left behind."
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM4:0 "Subsidise Culture"
SWE_SENREF_SOSDEM4_desc:0 "We cannot forget about art, poetry and music. By giving grants to writers and artists we can encourage the development of popular culture. Perhaps there can even be a future where Swedish musicians are famous all over the world?"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL:0 "Tax Cuts"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL_desc:0 "Taxation is theft. A little might be necessary but too much is definitely bad. Public funds will suffer, but it is a small price to pay when property rights are on the line."
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL1:0 "Deregulation"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL1_desc:0 "We cannot allow our businesses to get caught up in unnecessary red tape. We must rid ourselves of useless legislation and streamline the market to make it more efficient."
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL2:0 "Abolish State Media"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL2_desc:0 "It's time that people are made to form their own opinions, rather than be fed what the government wants to feed them. Sveriges Television has had a good run, but this relic of pseudo-indoctrination has to go away for our society to truly become free. While this might make our society less unified, encouraging free thought is always the right thing to do."
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL3:0 "Encourage Immigration"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL3_desc:0 "We should make it lucrative for the best and brightest to flock to our country. Show the world that Sweden is the best place to go if you want to get far in life on our own merits."
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL4:0 "Free Trade"
SWE_SENREF_LIBERAL4_desc:0 "People should be free to come and go across our border, and so should commerce and goods. By removing all barriers to international trade we will make it cheaper for everyone to import Swedish goods and services, increasing our exports."
SWE_SENREF_CON:0 "Protectionism"
SWE_SENREF_CON_desc:0 "We must see to it that our vital resources are not used to produce weapons that will be turned against us. Swedish resources for the Swedish people. Plain and simple."
SWE_SENREF_CON1:0 "Look to the Church"
SWE_SENREF_CON1_desc:0 "Sweden is a christian nation. We have to be a virtuous state that conducts its affairs in an ethical manner. Some people seem to have forgotten this, and it has resulted in what is tantamount to modern slavery. Statare is a black stain on Sweden, and it must be abolished."
SWE_SENREF_CON2:0 "Centralise the Economy"
SWE_SENREF_CON2_desc:0 "We can steal some ideas from the left and collectivise parts of our industry. Our means of production should serve the greater good of the nation, not the interests of money-hungry individuals."
SWE_SENREF_NAT1:0 "Look to the Military"
SWE_SENREF_NAT1_desc:0 "Sweden is a proud nation with a rich culture and glorious history. We need a strong state that can protect its citizens from threats that arise both from within and without. By embedding the military in our culture we can ensure that the younger generation adopts patriotic values."
SWE_SENREF_NAT2:0 "Conscripted Labour"
SWE_SENREF_NAT2_desc:0 "The concept of Statare is not entirely a bad one. We should enact legislation that allows us to conscript unemployed citizens into a national labour corps. Everyone has to work or our proud nation will fall behind in development."
SWE_SENREF_CON3:0 "State Education"
SWE_SENREF_CON3_desc:0 "We should provide education for all and make sure that our children grow up to be strong, intelligent and patriotic men and women that will be ready to serve our glorious society."
SWE_SENREF_CON4:0 "Restrict Voting Rights"
SWE_SENREF_CON4_desc:0 "Everyone is not fit to vote. Some people are more knowledgeable and reasonable than others. By going back to our old pre-Weltkrieg ways we can return this country to its glory days."
SWE_SENREF_CON5:0 "Reinstate the Monarchy"
SWE_SENREF_CON5_desc:0 "The king is still a very influential figure, perhaps more now than ever. Only through his leadership can our country be made great again. We will form a royalist government that can support our monarch in the parliament."
SWE_SENREF_NAT3:0 "Press Censorship"
SWE_SENREF_NAT3_desc:0 "If the strikes and riots have taught us anything it is that free speech is dangerous. We cannot allow toxic ideas like socialism to infect our country. New laws must be enacted to restrict unpatriotic activities."
SWE_SENREF_NAT5:0 "Embrace Dictatorship"
SWE_SENREF_NAT5_desc:0 "Democracy is dead. The experiment, while interesting, has proven to be nothing but detrimental to Sweden. As our people embraces patriotism and national values there is simply no need to vote as the consensus already exists. We trust in our government."
SWE_SENREF_POP1:0 "Military Education"
SWE_SENREF_POP1_desc:0 "The only way to make sure that our children grow up with the right values is to task the military with the education of our youth. They will learn patriotism, diligence and discipline."
SWE_SENREF_POP2:0 "Fanatic Militarism"
SWE_SENREF_POP2_desc:0 "With each and every Swede ready to die for his country, we can finally rest knowing that our future is in good hands."
SWE_SENREF_POP3:0 "Stratocracy"
SWE_SENREF_POP3_desc:0 "The military must take over all government duties. Only the most decisive and loyal of our countrymen should be allowed to assume leadership roles within our nation. Glory to Sweden."
SWE_SENREF_STATARE1:0 "Abolish Statare"
SWE_SENREF_STATARE1_desc:0 "Statare is basically a form of modern slavery. How can we pretend to be a nation of equal opportunity while such travesties are allowed to occur on our soil?"
SWE_SENREF_STATARE2:0 "Corporatize Statare"
SWE_SENREF_STATARE2_desc:0 "Having statare be simply a one-year work option for the poor is awfully inefficient. Instead of having the law restrict this valuable economic asset, we should allow corporations to offer whatever contract they want."
SWE_SENREF_COLLECT:0 "Collectivist Ethos"
SWE_SENREF_COLLECT_desc:0 "While we each have our own lives and ambitions, we also have a duty to take care of each other. The individual must step aside for the greater good."
SWE_SENREF_INDIV:0 "Individualist Ethos"
SWE_SENREF_INDIV_desc:0 "Groups do not have rights. Individuals do. By allowing maximum agency for the individual every man and woman will be able to pursue their dreams and ambitions. This is the driving force behind capitalism and the only way that an economy can be both free and just."
SWE_SENREF_CORP:0 "Corporatist Ethos"
SWE_SENREF_CORP_desc:0 "Men are merely cogs in a greater machine. While some individuals rise to shine above others the sad truth is that most people will never be anything more than mere plebs. The corporation is the perfect combination of individual drive and a collective mind working together."



SWE_SENREF_DOCTRINE:0 "ÖB"
SWE_SENREF_DOCTRINE_desc:0 "There is a limit to how well our Generals can cooperate. We need to establish a new role. Överbefälhavare (Supreme Commander) to sit at the top of our armed forces."

SWE_RAPPECAB:0 "The Rappe Cabinet"
SWE_RAPPECAB_desc:0 "While at first we were all grateful for Rappe's brave actions during the turmoil, everyone is now wondering what will happen to Sweden. He has yet to allow any politicians back into the parliament and when by the bottle, he admitted to some friends that he had no intention to return power now that it was seized. Sweden is at a crossroads."

SWE_NEWECO:0 "The New Economy"
SWE_NEWECO_desc:0 "Our old economy of private enterprise and big businesses must come to an end, on that much we all agree.

SWE_NEWECO_tooltip:0 "§ROur economy will suffer for a while until things stabilise...§! \n"
SWE_NEWMIL:0 "The New Military"
SWE_NEWMIL_desc:0 "Our generals are known for their love of the autocratic right, in particular Germany. We need a new army, ready to fight for our brand of socialism! Some argue for a grand peasant and worker's army to spread the flames of revolution, while others in the committee believe our army should be reduced and exist only to defend our revolution."
SWE_NEWMIL_tooltip:0 "§ROur military will be unruly for a while until things stabilise...§! \n"
SWE_NEWSOC:0 "The New Society"
SWE_NEWSOC_desc:0 "Society is more complex than production quotas, union meetings and bombastic pamphlets. The way we form our new society and political system will influence Sweden for decades to come. We must choose carefully."

SWE_NEWSWE:0 "The New Sweden"
SWE_NEWSWE_desc:0 "After many months of intense political work, discussions, counter-proposals and spiteful threats, the reforms of Sweden have come to an end.

SWE_NORREV:0 "A Scandinavian Revolution"
SWE_NORREV_desc:0 "Our red brothers in Finland, Denmark and Norway are waiting for us to unite them under our banners. It's time to reform the broken union of 1905, but instead of with Kings, with workers and peasants side by side!"

SWE_WORREV_desc:0 "Our revolutionary cause is bigger than ourselves. It's time we align to one of the major factions who shares our cause and belief!"

SWE_EQUA:0 "An Equal Society"
SWE_EQUA_desc:0 "To establish Folkhemmet in the minds of our ministers and our people is merely the first step. Next, we need to make sure that you are treated fairly by society and by people, not by who you were born as but how you chose to live your life."
SWE_INDUREF:0 "Industrial reforms"
SWE_INDUREF_desc:0 "After years of conservative rule our industry has not been able to keep up the race with other nations. We'll start by reforming the work place, ensuring strong unions and protection for our workers."
SWE_AGRREF:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
SWE_AGRREF_desc:0 "A 'Statare' is a farm-worker with extremely poor legal protection and rights, finding themselves paid in consumer goods such as potatoes and flour. This ends now. Honest wages for honest work!"
SWE_BASDEM:0 "On the Basis of Democracy"
SWE_BASDEM_desc:0 "Sweden has gone through some rough patches in the last few years. We must strengthen our democracy by protecting the legal rights of our citizens and protect them from any form of state harassment."

SWE_SDINDU_desc:0 "With a strong base to stand upon our industry goes forward, only forward!"

SWE_THEOLDW:0 "The Old Way"
SWE_THEOLDWdesc:0 "With the election finally done with it's time for our government to decide what route we intend to take our nation in. Our 'new' cabinet will hardly surprise anyone, but there's some sense of security in knowing what's to come."
SWE_FREETRADE:0 "Free-trade Economy"
SWE_FREETRADE_desc:0 "The market liberals of our government have proposed investing in a merchant fleet. Sweden is rich of natural resources and our people, and government, could benefit greatly if we sold some of them on the world market."
SWE_SUPPPVTBUS:0 "Support Private Businesses"
SWE_SUPPPVTBUS_desc:0 "Our economy could do with some further investments and a good way to get it running would be to make it easier to start small businesses. Every town should have its own shop!"
SWE_SUBTRADE:0 "Subsidize Our Trade"
SWE_SUBTRADE_desc:0 "With major subsidies put into our foreign trade we could set up a trade-network strong enough to feed Sweden for generations to come."
SWE_GERIRON:0 "German Iron Trade"
SWE_GERIRON_desc:0 "To trade iron with Germany has been beneficial for Sweden for a long time, but it is time we intensify those trade lines. It'll be rewarding for us and the Germans alike, no doubt!"
SWE_NORBLOC:0 "The Nordic Bloc"
SWE_NORBLOC_desc:0 "Rather than trading with the autocratic state of Germany, we should look to our Scandinavian brothers. We have been good friends for a long time now, and it is only natural that we set up our own trade Bloc with reduced tolls and easy of access for companies and traders."


SWE_PROTECTIONIST:0 "Protectionist Economy"
SWE_PROTECTIONIST_desc:0 "There's a group of influential men in Sweden who believe that our nation needs to be protected, both in its economy and in its rule. Foreign ideas such as socialism and democracy have no place in Sweden, so they all agree. This worries the more moderate conservative politicians, but they won't be in power for long..."
SWE_BIGBUS:0 "Big Business Sponsorship"
SWE_BIGBUS_desc:0 "Our friends, the big businesses and wealthy landlords, helped us win this election. It's time we pay them back. First on the agenda would be to help ease tensions on the countryside by reforming the Statar-system, at least to some degree. Perhaps a middle-ground can be found?"
SWE_CORPOR:0 "Corporate Statare"
SWE_CORPOR_desc:0 "The system with Statarna is bad only because of how inefficient it is. The idea of having a large work-force without the right to change work-place or complain seems ingenious. We should optimise it and ensure the police force is strengthened enough to deal with any dissent."
SWE_GODKING:0 "Traditional Unity"
SWE_GODKING_desc:0 "In Sweden it hasn't traditionally been about class or even about politics it all. It was about respect the King and God. We should restore the old rights of the clergy to increase their influence in society and instruct the arch-bishop to pray for the King."
SWE_IRONMILI:0 "Iron fist of the Military"
SWE_IRONMILI_desc:0 "While our power is secure for now, there's no guarantee it will stay like this forever. We should make it clear to our citizens that this is a permanent, not a temporary, government and install our people into key positions."
SWE_REDSCARE:0 "Swedish Red Scare"

SWE_STRONGSTATE_desc:0 "With an outside enemy it becomes increasingly easy to tighten our hold on the government in general and in society as a whole. We are almost there..."
SWE_RAMNAT:0 "Rampant Nationalism"
SWE_RAMNAT_desc:0 "With the Swedish flag flying high in every city and town of Sweden, it's no wonder that the king asks the leader of the soaring Fosterländska Stiftelsen to form a new government. There's no doubt that democracy is dying in Sweden, and this might very well be the final nail in the coffin."
SWE_REAROY:0 "Look to the Crown"
SWE_REAROY_desc:0 "With the King, much to the Queen's pleasure, gaining popularity unmatched by most politicians, it isn't strange that he asks his close personal friend Sven Hedin to form a new government. The old adventurer, royalist and author has never seemed as proud as he is today, ending Swedish democracy with a proud smile."
SWE_MILIPRO:0 "Permanent Military Government"
SWE_MILIPRO_desc:0 "Axel Rappe has declared in a public statement that in order to safeguard Sweden from inner and foreign enemies, the military must regretably sieze permanent control of Swedish authorities.

SWE_STROMBACK:0 "Ehrensvärd's plan"
SWE_STROMBACK_desc:0 "Gösta Ehrensvärd believes that Sweden should not and can not afford to surrender the seas to our enemies. He suggests an ambitious naval expansion plan relying on the combined arms of ships and naval bombers."
SWE_PALMSTIERNA:0 "Tamm's plan"
SWE_PALMSTIERNA_desc:0 "Fabian Tamm, always the pragmatic realist, believes that a Swedish fleet should be centred around cheaper vessels, such as destroyers and submarines."
SWE_EXPANDNAVY1:0 "Göteborgsvarvet"
SWE_EXPANDNAVY1_desc:0 "The Göteborg wharf, Göteborgsvarvet, has served to produce military vessels for the Swedish navy for hundreds of years. It must be expanded further and, equally important, defences must be erected to protect it."

SWE_DESTROYER1:0 "Destroyer Focus"
SWE_DESTROYER1_desc:0 "Destroyers are cheap and surprisingly powerful ships. We should expand our Destroyer fleet."

SWE_DOCPALM:0 "Karlskrona Naval Officer's Academy"
SWE_DOCPALM_desc:0 "In the new Karlskrona Naval Officer's School we prepare our future staff for the type of wars to come.

SWE_NAVALPROD2:0 "Kockums Mekaniska Verkstad"
SWE_NAVALPROD2_desc:0 "The wharf of Malmö launched both HMS Tapperheten and HMS Manligheten. And still they will need to expand even more to meet our needs. Through a government effort we will soon be able to dominate the Baltic as we did hundreds of years ago!"

SWE_ENTEDIPLO:0 "Entente Diplomacy"
SWE_ENTEDIPLO_desc:0 "It's time to send our actual diplomats to do the dirty work. The navy staff assures us though that everything will go very smooth indeed."

SWE_SVENSKTIGER:0 "A Swedish Tiger"
SWE_SVENSKTIGER_desc:0 "En Svensk Tiger, a Swede Tiger, is a word-play in Swedish on the words Tiger (Tiger) and Tiger (holds silent). A well-timed propaganda campaign will remind our citizens to keep their mouths shut as in theory, anyone could be a foreign spy."
SWE_HALLGRANSEN:0 "Hold The Border!"
SWE_HALLGRANSEN_desc:0 "No matter what happens, foreign nations must respect the borders of Sweden. We will not let any armies not belonging to Sweden cross them!"
SWE_ARMYLINE:0 "The Army Line"
SWE_ARMYLINE_desc:0 "Several outspoken members of our military staff have claimed that in this unsafe world, the best course of action would be to align to Germany and MittelEuropa. While this might lead to conflicts with the Entente and the reds our staff informs us that they pose no threat to the unbreakable MittelEuropa."
SWE_GERDIPLO:0 "German Diplomacy"
SWE_GERDIPLO_desc:0 "With our royal household and military so closely connected to the German Reich, it's no wonder that things are going so smoothly for our diplomats."

SWE_THORNELL:0 "The Thörnell Plan"

SWE_STATPOL:0 "Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
SWE_STATPOL_desc:0 "Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten is the brain-child of Carlos Adlercreutz and will act as our new, vastly expanded intelligence service. It will serve us very well when it comes to rooting out dissidents and keeping foreign ideas at bay, as well as warning us about anything our enemies might be up to."
SWE_FRA:0 "Försvarets Radioanstalt"
SWE_FRA_desc:0 "The Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) has existed even since before the Weltkrieg, but they have for long been underfunded. With proper investments, we can make sure they have access to anything and everything they need."
SWE_LABORDIV:0 "Work Brigades"
SWE_LABORDIV_desc:0 "There's no gaurantee that a person of a certain age-group has it in them to be a soldier. It is wasted manpower to just send them on their way though. We should establish civilian work brigades that focus on erecting military installations."
SWE_DEFENSE:0 "Defensive Armies"

SWE_HEMVARN_desc:0 "Olof Thörnell has hired a man he trusts, Gustaf Petri, to help establish a more effective variant of Landstormen. With proper investments, a new army called Hemvärnet (Home guard) can be raised. This will increase our manpower, without reduing troop quality!"

SWE_LOTTOR1_desc:0 "Lottakåren used to be the women's wing of Landstormen, and in wartime they can serve with some civilian services, such as repairing and sewing clothes, handing out food and more. If we expand upon this idea, it can boost our military efficiency."
SWE_LOTTORAUX:0 "Permanent the Auxiliary Service"
SWE_LOTTORAUX_desc:0 "Lottorna is doing us a good service but we could permanent a greater auxiliary service, such as enemy bomber spotting for the air defences and for other non-combatant positions."

SWE_ATTDAN:0 "Subjugate Denmark"

SWE_TOEAST:0 "Look East"
SWE_TOEAST_desc:0 "Finland will regret not surrendering us Åland after the Weltkrieg. The problem is that the island was granted to them by the Germans, and they might back Finland up should a conflict arise. We should send out warnings and see how the Germans react."
SWE_DEMFIN:0 "Demand Swedish Finland"

### Heads of state ###
POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament. \n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around. \n\nHe is married to the sickly Queen Victoria of Baden, who is known to be wearing the pants in the Royal household, especially concerning the King's attempted influence in politics in general and the close relations to Germany in particular."
POLITICS_REVOLUTIONARY_COMMITTEE_DESC:0 "The Revolutionary Committee of Sweden consists of a a motley crew of most people of the radical left, from journalists and theorists to poets and to hard-working men and women, sailors, farmers, factory workers and union men. Everyone and anyone with a bit of popularity and backing who is trying to influence Sweden's future can be found here and most discussions in the assembly ends with shouts, dramatic quotes and insults, often accompanied by applauding, booing and whistles. \n\nProminent radical socialist, Karl Kilbom, has been heard saying that it is more like going to a game of soccer than it is going to a meeting for political debates."

politics_axel_rappe_desc:0 "Axel Rappe was born in 1884, son of the then Swedish Minister of War, also named Axel Rappe. As such, Rappe had a military career laid out before him, and he graduated from both the Artillery- and Engineer-Academy and the Academy of War. He eventually became a teacher at the Artillery- and Engineer-Academy before, at the rank of captain in 1917 resigned from the Swedish army to volunteer on the white side in the Finnish civil war. He quickly became an important member of the Chief of Staff in the Finnish war and fought it to the end before returning to Sweden and resuming his duties. \n\nHe is renowned for running a newspaper advocating for increased military spending (and increase military influence in general) and leading the All-or-nothing group, a circle of politically involved conservative officers. Lastly, there are times when he does reach for the bottle a bit too often."
politics_sven_hedin_desc:0 "Sven Hedin is a former adventurer, author and staunch supporter of the royal family."
politics_martin_ekstrom_desc:0 "Martin Ekström was born in 1887 as the son of a maid, and became the foster-son of her husband. Early on he made a career in the military and served as an officer of the Swedish reserve before he, in 1911, had a German-Persian service tour in Persia until 1915, fighting off everything from highway robbers to Russian advances in Hamadan. After returning to Sweden, the Finnish civil war soon broke out, and he joined the whites in fighting against the reds. \n\nHe was one of the leading hands behind the Vyborg massacre in 1918 and he stayed in Finland, Vaasa, for another decade after the war ended as an officer of the Swedish army. During the Ådalen events he reportedly told friends that he was ready to bring Finnish units into Sweden to violently strike 'the reds'. Shortly afterwards he did return to Sweden, although without any Finnish units, enlisted as an officer in the Swedish army, joined a staunchly nationalist party and became an editor of the Riksposten newspaper, promoting these values."
politics_axel_pehrsson_desc:0 "Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp is a Swedish politician and farmer from Skåne."
politics_bertil_ohlin_desc:0 "Bertil Ohlin is a professor of economics and a Swedish politician, strongly influenced by his liberal and pro-Scandinavian-unity mother."
politics_gosta_bagge_desc:0 "Gösta Bagge is a professor of economics and a Swedish right-wing politician."

politics_karl_kilblom_desc:0 "Karl Kilbom was born in 1885 in the Uppland region. His father was a smith who, when he tried to form a union, recieved threats from his employer and told Karl to stay out of politics. When he eventually moved away from his father (the mother passed away when he was young) he found a job as a sailor before eventually being drafted and serving at the ship HMS Svea in 1907. \n\nAfter his military service he moved to Göteborg, where he met big names in the left movement. Soon enough Kilbom started doing journalistic work for various political newspapers and became a big name in the far left movement of Sweden. Despite various splits and inner conflicts Kilbom has managed to stay close to power."
politics_karin_boye_desc:0 "Karin Boye was born in October 1900. Both her parents came from well-off families who supplied Karin Boye with high quality studies, studies which she performed very well in. She finished her studies to become a teacher, but is much more famous for her poetry and writing. She strongly identifies with the socialist and feminist movements of Sweden and in 1927 she becomes an editor at a socialist newspaper. \n\nShe visited Germany (she had German ancestry in her family) and lives in Berlin from 1932 to 1933, where she confronts her sexuality and starts living more or less openly with another woman, Margot Hanel, a German Jewish woman. The two of them return to Sweden, where Boye continues to develop her interest in politics and poetry. \n\nThanks to her popularity she managed to avoid legal confrontration regarding her sexual deviancy, and during the election of 1936, when the Syndicalists snatched a surprise victory, she used her fame and skill with words to win a high position in the movement."
politics_elise_jensen_desc:0 "Elise Ottesen-Jensen, called Ottar, was born in 1886 in then Swedish Norway. She was the seventeenth of eighteen children in between a priest and a bishop's daughter. Her relations with her family became very strained when she refused Christianity and God in her early teenage years and, unlike many of her siblings, looked for a career outside of the church. \n\nInstead, she became a dentist's assistant, although an accident costing her two of her fingers ended that career quickly. Instead, she became a stenographer and wrote articles for various syndicalist and socialist papers until she met Albert Jensen, her future husband. They eventually married and moved to Copenhagen and later Stockholm. \n\nShe started a Women's newspaper and acted as a sort of sexual educator and agitator of women's rights, recognising the many struggles of the Scandinavian working class woman, with poverty, responsibility for the children, running double jobs and abusive marriages. Eventually she started touring the country, holding gatherings and sex ed evening classes all around the country. In these she turned out to be a skilled agitator."
politics_albert_jensen_desc:0 "Albert Jensen was born in 1879 in Landskrona in a very poor family. His father died when he was only seven, and with many siblings to care for the household lived through cold winters and hungry summers. As a eighteen year old he formed a Socialist Youth organisation and ended up in prison for a total of two years in between 1906-1910, for various illegal political demonstrations. \n\nAfterwards he moved to France to study the syndicalist movements there and turned out to be such a strong personality that he ended up representing SAC (the Syndicalist party of Sweden) at the 1913 Syndicalist meeting in London. With the start of the Weltkrieg, the states of Europe were harsher with political dissidents and Albert had to live underground for some time, with a false name, while still producing articles and pamphlets for various syndicalist causes. \n\nAfter meeting his wife-to-be the two of them moved around Sweden, holding public speeches and producing articles on various revolutionary topics. Much like his wife, Albert is a very skilled demagogue."
politics_sven_linderot_desc:0 "Sven Linderot was born in 1889. Already at eleven years of age he would start working in a local glass-works where he worked for another twelve years. At first he was politically engaged in the Social Democratic party, but was purged for his radical viewpoints in 1916. He was an active unionist and eventually journalist and politician. \n\nHe has for a long time promoted a hard-line type of centralism which most moderate syndicalists feel nothing but contempt for, but he is a hard-worker and as an editor-in-chief of a large Socialist newspaper Norrskensflamman, he has managed to win a devoted crowd."
politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "Nils flyg was born in 1891 as the son of a sugar factory worker. Nils himself studied to and later worked as a typographer and found his political home early in the Social Democratic party. He split from them during the Weltkrieg however, and joined a more radical, hard-line socialist movement. \n\nWhile he wasn't the biggest of the names in Swedish syndicalism shortly after the Weltkrieg, he soon found strong political allies on the international scene in Mosley and Mussolini, who share many of his ideas of a strong, centralised state. By the mid-twenties he turned out to be one of the biggest names in radical left Sweden, running his own newspaper and acting as a bit of an informal leader of the Totalist faction."

### Intro events ###

swe.65.t:0 "The Political Situation"
swe.65.d:0 "In the last few elections a coalition of the Conservative party and the market liberals repeatedly defeated a split social democratic and syndicalist movement. Currently governed by Gösta Bagge the nation struggles with balancing the needs of the people and the needs of the government. While Sweden has industrialised, the violent revolutions of Russia, France and Britain have all intimidated the moderate Swedish electorate away from the generally strong left... Until now. \n\nThe charismatic Per Albin Hansson has managed to rush ahead in the polls with his Social democratic party. Sweden's next election will be mid-September 1936."
swe.65.a:0 "I can't wait!"

swe.66.t:0 "The military situation"
swe.66.d:0 "The army staff has gained a decent base of political power with a seemingly ever dangerous world around them. Axel Rappe and Olof Thörnell, big names in the military staff, are known as staunch supporters of Germany and want Sweden to abandon their neutrality politics while several key members of the fleet, including prolific Erik Palmstierna, are big admirers of the British royal house and classic British liberalism. \n\nIn both fleet and army circles there is a strong support for 'liberating' the Swedish-speaking people's of Western Finland and Åland. For now they are both content at mumbling to each other in the officer's mess but should the elected government seem weak, or should war come to Sweden's borders, things could change very quickly."
swe.66.a:0 "Best be prepared!"

swe.67.t:0 "The Royal Household"
swe.67.d:0 "Swedish royalty has seen stronger kings. The last time Gustav V Bernadotte attempted to influence Swedish politics he was pushed by his wife, Queen Victoria, and other royalists to hold the infamous Borggårdstalet (The Bailey Speech) in 1914, where he criticised the disarmament which the liberal government were to execute, and referred to both army and navy as 'his'. It lead to a parliamentarian crisis, as the King wasn't allowed to use his power to hinder the decisions of the government, nor was the army to be considered his.\n\n Now Gustav V Bernadotte prefers to stay on friendly terms with politicians, although it is known that Queen Victoria wears the pants in the royal household. She, of German stock, is not happy to see royalty sidelined. Despite her failing health she urges the King to act whenever the government seems weak."
swe.67.a:0 "For King and country!"

swe.68.t:0 "Foreign relations"
swe.68.d:0 "Sweden has survived the last 150 years of war by sticking to a non-negotiable neutrality type of foreign politics. Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct wars. \n\n Close relations are held with both Norway and Denmark, whose people's are considered brothers to the Swedish people, although relations are frosty with Finland after the dispute with the Åland isles. Still, talks of strong syndicalist movements in Norway worry the military high command and things could change quickly."
swe.68.a:0 "Brödrafolk!"

### Swedish Socialism Elections ###

swe.1.t:0 "The first Revolutionary Committee assembly"
swe.1.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has been assembled for its first session. Tensions are high as all three parties are vying for power in this new, strange political climate. Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far. \n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Vänsterpartiet Totalisterna (VPT) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Syndikalistiska Parti (SSP) claims that every commune should look after their own."
swe.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe.1.b:0 "Kilbom wins this round."
swe.1.c:0 "Nils Flyg controls the debate."

swe.2.t:0 "The second Revolutionary Committee assembly"
swe.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights. \n\nThe VPT representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."
swe.2.a:0 "Sjöström has the right of it."
swe.2.b:0 "Visborg wins this round."
swe.2.c:0 "Linderot controls the debate."

swe.3.t:0 "The third Revolutionary Committee assembly"
swe.3.d:0 "For a third time the Revolutionary Committee holds session. With the current military disloyal to the red cause, the various leaders are discussing radical army reforms. Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks. \n\nGustav Johansson from VPT claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SSP representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."
swe.3.a:0 "Lätt has the right of it."
swe.3.b:0 "Höglund wins this round."
swe.3.c:0 "Johansson controls the debate."

swe.4.t:0 "The fourth Revolutionary Committee assembly"
swe.4.d:0 "Our fourth session has been assembled. Outside the doors, Sweden lies in chaos, but inside we are assured we can sort it out. Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV. \n\nHilding Hagberg from VPT believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivalled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SSP representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."
swe.4.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe.4.b:0 "Undén wins this round."
swe.4.c:0 "Hagberg controls the debate."

swe.51.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #Totalist#
swe.51.d:0 "The Totalists have achieved a total victory in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new Totalist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make. \n\nWho should sit there? Linderot and Flyg, both former editors in chief, are strong, capable men who have proved themselves during debates and in general political work."
swe.51.a:0 "Sven Linderot is our man."
swe.51.b:0 "Nils Flyg will raise Sweden to the sky."

swe.52.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #RadicalSocialist#
swe.52.d:0 "The Radical Socialists have won in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new radical socialist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make. \n\nWho should sit there? Many thought of Kilbom, a former sailor and journalist, as the obvious choice, but the famous and incredibly popular poet and writer Karin Boye has soared in the party ranks as of late."
swe.52.a:0 "Karl Kilbom is what Sweden needs."
swe.52.b:0 "And the day is you, Karin Boye."

swe.53.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #Syndicalist#
swe.53.d:0 "The Syndicalists have won in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new syndicalist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make. \n\nWho should sit there? The last draw has come down in between husband and wife with Elise, a former sex-educator and agitator against Albert, a former journalist and demagogue."
swe.53.a:0 "Elise Ottosen-Jensen is our choice."
swe.53.b:0 "Albert Jensen is our first pick."

swe.54.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #Socialists/Totalists#
swe.54.d:0 "The battle has been hard fought in the revolutionary assemblies. The Totalists and the Radical Socialists have both gained and held ground. With a new regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a difficult decisions to make. Who should sit there? \n\nEither the Totalist option of Linderot, a former editor in chief, will shoulder the responsibility or perhaps Kilbom, the former sailor and journalist is a better choice? Either way, one side is doomed to feel left out, and Sweden might suffer from this split."

### Swedish Faction/Land Events ###

swe.71.t:0 "A Scandinavian revolution"
swe.71.d:0 "The flames of revolution has spread throughout Scandinavia and now we must protect it. The revolutions of Britain and France are not ours. We must safeguard it, shoulder to shoulder with the workers of Norway, Denmark and Finland!"
swe.71.a:0 "Join us in our righteous cause, brothers of Norway!"

swe.72.t:0 "A world revolution"
swe.72.d:0 "The flames of syndicalism reaches all across the globe. We should join a red faction, to help protect ourselves from the reactionary forces wanting to overthrow our government!"
swe.72.a:0 "The first internationale of the French is ours too!"
swe.72.b:0 "We must approach the union of Britain."
swe.72.c:0 "The Soviet Union has the right of it."

swe.73.t:0 "Approaching the Entente"
swe.73.d:0 "The Entente are guided by the British, the forefathers of liberalism. We respect their royal family and all of their democratic ideals. It is only natural that we join sides."
swe.73.a:0 "We will help you bring back you home isles!"

swe.74.t:0 "Approaching MittelEuropa"
swe.74.d:0 "The Germans have been our trading partners and friends ever since the middle ages and during the Weltkrieg there were many who wished for Sweden to join Germany in the struggle against the British. It is time we pick a side."
swe.74.a:0 "The Kaiser and the King, as comrades in arms!"

swe.75.t:0 "The Åland negotiations"
swe.75.d:0 "The Åland isles are as Swedish as Stockholm, and still they are controlled but the Finnish. However, where the sword failed, the pen might succeed. Now that we are on better terms with Finland, we might be able to offer them a lucrative deal for an Åland purchase. Naturally, we'll guarantee that the mainland Finnish provinces remain Finnish."
swe.75.a:0 "Åland, return to us!"

swe.76.t:0 "The Åland negotiations succeeded!"
swe.76.d:0 "After long and, at times, harsh negotiations we have managed to strike a deal with Finland. We will purchase Åland from them, and even though it might be expensive, it'll be worth it! We have also surrendered any claims to mainland Finland."
swe.76.a:0 "What a bargain!"

swe.77.t:0 "The Åland negotiations fail!"
swe.77.d:0 "Despite offering nothing but excellent terms and friendly manners the offerings of our diplomats have been rejected! Our military is outraged and the public demands to know what happened! What should we do?"
swe.77.a:0 "What a shame. We can still be friends though."
swe.77.b:0 "How dare they?! This means war!"

swe.78.t:0 "The Scandinavian Alliance"
swe.78.d:0 "Scandinavia cannot stand alone in these volatile times. Sooner or later war will come to our borders, and when it does, we must be ready to protect not only ourselves, but each other."
swe.78.a:0 "Finnländare, vårt brodersfolk!"

swe.79.t:0 "Pressure Finland"
swe.79.d:0 "For long enough, Finland have oppressed the Swedish minority living inside their borders, both on Åland but also along the western and southern coastline of Finland. However, rattling the sabers might awake the Germans, and everything needs to be handled delicately."
swe.79.a:0 "Hopefully the Germans won't mind!"

swe.80.t:0 "Germany supports Finland"
swe.80.d:0 "German diplomats spent several hours yesterday informing our parliament that they will not stand for any Swedish attempts upon Finnish soil, and will not hesitate to intervene in support of Finland should any conflicts spiral out of control. However, there's a chance it's all talk. If Germany are busy with other wars, there's a good chance they might not be able to do anything."
swe.80.a:0 "We must back down."
swe.80.b:0 "Germany won't stop us!"

swe.81.t:0 "Germany joins the war"
swe.81.d:0 "German diplomats have informed us that we are now officially at war, as they are supporting Finland in the armed conflict. The might of MittelEuropa will soon be upon us."
swe.81.a:0 "They shall fear the Lion from the land of the midnight sun!"

swe.82.t:0 "Germany abandons Finland"
swe.82.d:0 "Despite earlier promises, Germany has decided not to respond to Finland's call for support. Finland now stands alone and soon enough, Swedish troops will surely hold victory parades in Helsingfors!"
swe.82.a:0 "Öst-Sverige has a good ring to it, no?"

swe.83.t:0 "Finland stands alone"
swe.83.d:0 "The desperate pleas of Finland seem to have fallen upon deaf ears in Berlin, for Germany have not done anything more than leave a few formal complaints, asking us to respect the borders of Europe. There's no mention of military intervention. Finland stands alone."
swe.83.a:0 "Öst-Sverige has a good ring to it, no?"

swe.84.t:0 "Denmark approached"
swe.84.d:0 "The Danes are, like all Scandinavian people's, our brothers. They are, next to Finland, the most exposed nation of the North, bordering the rest of Europe. They will surely be nothing but grateful for our offering of an alliance."
swe.84.a:0 "Come to us, brothers!"

swe.85.t:0 "Denmark accepts our proposal"
swe.85.d:0 "The Danish have accepted our proposal of a formal alliance! Scandinavia grows!"
swe.85.a:0 "Hurrah for Sweden and Denmark!"

swe.86.t:0 "Denmark denied our proposal"
swe.86.d:0 "The Danes have denied our proposal. No wonder, we couldn't understand a thing their diplomat said with all that porridge in his mouth!"
swe.86.a:0 "Med plutonium, Danskjävlar!"

swe.87.t:0 "Norway approached"
swe.87.d:0 "The Norwegians are, like all Scandinavian people's, our brothers. Even more so because of the union which split in 1905. While we doubt they'll want to enter a union with us again due to their fierce patriotism, we can surely persuade them to join an alliance with us, to help protect each other from a large, dangerous world."
swe.87.a:0 "Come to us, brothers!"

swe.88.t:0 "Norway accepts our alliance"
swe.88.d:0 "It comes as no surprise to us that the Norwegians have seen the sense of our brilliant proposal. Scandinavia continues to grow!"
swe.88.a:0 "Forever united in brotherhood!"

swe.89.t:0 "Norway rejects our proposal"
swe.89.d:0 "The Norwegians, a cunning, sly and ungrateful people, have once again shown their true nature. They have rejected our proposal of an alliance."
swe.89.a:0 "Hmpf! We are better off this way!"

swe.90.t:0 "Entente accepts us into the fold"
swe.90.d:0 "The British accepted our alliance proposal, and it is no wonder. Sweden can act as an excellent mounting ground for any operations in Europe, but we must make sure that we do not only give in this relationship, but also take."
swe.90.a:0 "Beneficial to both of us!"

swe.91.t:0 "We are part of MittelEuropa"
swe.91.d:0 "The Germans opened their arms and let us in. No doubt they'll be expect us to aid them in any wars to come, but with them at our back, hopefully our home borders will be safe."
swe.91.a:0 "The Kaiser and the King, as comrades in arms!"

swe.92.t:0 "Entente denies our proposal"
swe.92.d:0 "The British have decided to deny our request to join the Entente. We can only speculate as to why, but for now, Sweden is without any allies."
swe.92.a:0 "Sweden is alone"

swe.93.t:0 "German negotiations fail"
swe.93.d:0 "Our negotiations with the Germans failed and it would seem that the Kaiser believes he has little to gain by letting us join the MittelEuropa faction. Sweden stands alone..."
swe.93.a:0 "They'll rue this day!"

swe.94.t:0 "Alliance proposal accepted"
swe.94.d:0 "Our proposal for an alliance has been accepted!"
swe.94.a:0 "They'll rue this day!"

swe.95.t:0 "Alliance proposal rejected"
swe.95.d:0 "Our proposal for an alliance has been rejected!"
swe.95.a:0 "They'll rue this day!"

swe.96.t:0 "The Finns accepted"
swe.96.d:0 "Finland have decided to join our Scandinavian Pact! Together, we'll be unconquerable, without a doubt. Perhaps we should consider looking to Norway and Denmark now?"
swe.96.a:0 "Brödrafolk!"

swe.97.t:0 "Alliance proposal rejected"
swe.97.d:0 "Our proposal for an alliance with Finland has been rejected! We might be able to look to Norway or to Denmark instead."
swe.97.a:0 "They'll rue this day!"

swe.98.t:0 "Russia supports Finland"
swe.98.d:0 "Russia, an ally of Finland, has made it clear that they will not abandon Finland in case of a war. The Russian bear is a mighty foe and our most recent wars with them have not ended well..."
swe.98.a:0 "We can't afford another Poltava."
swe.98.b:0 "It will be a second Narva! Finland will fall!"

### 1936 Election ###

swe.6.t:0 "The contentious election of 1936"
swe.6.d:0 "The election of 1936 is dominated by underhanded tactics, stirred up emotions and veiled threats. Still, the Social democratic party look like they will be able to win the election by some margin, but not alone. Cooperation is necessary to secure a majority, although working with the radical left might stir some of the reactionary military staff to act out against the democratic results..."
swe.6.a:0 "The Social democrats win by allying with the radical left."
swe.6.b:0 "The Social democrats win by allying with the liberals."
swe.6.c:0 "The conservative party wins by vote manipulation."

swe.661.t:0 "Future with the Social Democrats"
swe.661.d:0 "Although there was some worry among the more well-off of our nation, it seems that the transition of power has gone smoothly. While the social democrats promise many reforms, they also encourage restraint and are quick to purge anyone too radical. The middle way is sacred."
swe.661.a:0 "The middle way shall be our way."

swe.61.t:0 "Riots and a coup!"
swe.61.d:0 "The barracks of Stockholm are ablaze after workers heard of plans to overthrow the newly elected regime! Perhaps one of the instigators mumbled a leak after having a glass too much, because suddenly leaflets appeared, warning of the end of the church, the monarchy and all else that is good about Sweden, should the radical left get in power. \n\nAn organisation called Arméns Fosterlandsvänner declares martial law as soldiers move to encircle the parliament while worker militias light up molotovs and arm themselves with bricks, knives and anything else they can get their hands on!"
swe.61.a:0 "The coup is successful!"
swe.61.b:0 "Thousands join the workers militias! The revolution is saved!"

swe.62.t:0 "Rappe saves us from the reds!"
swe.62.d:0 "When the dust finally settled in Stockholm, Malmö and Göteborg, workers and other rabble had been cleared from the streets. Some fifty socialists lay dead and hundreds of others wounded. Ring leaders sit in military custody as Axel Rappe appears to the public as the head of the coup. \n\nWith a steady voice he explains to military approved journalists that the situation is under control but that temporary martial law is necessary. The King has given his approval."
swe.62.a:0 "Thank you Rappe!"

swe.63.t:0 "The revolution lives!"
swe.63.d:0 "When the dust finally settled in Stockholm, Malmö and Göteborg, the noble workers have defeated the reactionary military. Many lay dead, and Riksdagshuset is burned to the ground. Preparations are already being made for building the Assembly Hall of the Revolution in its place. \n\nThe King prepares to leave the country while the Social Democrats see themselves almost completely sidelined by the more radical elements of Sweden."
swe.63.a:0 "Long live the revolution!"

swe.64.t:0 "Good old Sweden"
swe.64.d:0 "Although there have been reports in the media about election fraud, the minor strikes arranged by the opposition have either died out on their own or been dispersed by our brave military and police. With this election behind us, Sweden can finally continue to grow under our safe, traditional leadership."
swe.64.a:0 "Three Hurra's for King and country!"

### 1940 Election ###

swe.101.t:0 "The democratic election of 1940 "
swe.101.d:0 "The election of 1940 is, thanks to our reforms, a calm and polite affair. Despite the world being in turmoil, the Swedish political playing field is steady. The two sides, both respecting the democratic boundaries, have made clear platforms."
swe.101.a:0 "The Social democrats win by allying with the social liberals."
swe.101.b:0 "The Social conservatives win by allying with the market liberals."

swe.102.t:0 "The left-dominated election of 1940 "
swe.102.d:0 "The election of 1940 is, although fairly democratic, still strongly favouring the victors of the 1936 elections, as no proper reforms have been made to strengthen the democratic process of Sweden. The minority parties of the parliament find themselves not getting as much media coverage or support and are fighting an uphill battle."

swe.104.t:0 "The suppressed election of 1940 "
swe.104.d:0 "The elections of Sweden have been eagerly anticipated for the four last years, and now that they are here, it's time for us to make it clear to these commoners that there'll be no election. Protests have hit the streets, naturally, but we can deal with them."
swe.104.a:0 "Let's use cavalry to scatter these riots."

swe.105.t:0 "The syndicalist election of 1940 "
swe.105.d:0 "After four years of rule, it's time for a new Revolutionary congress to determine who should rule Sweden next. The Totalists, Syndicalists and Radical Socialists have all put forth their strongest names and the election is as close as ever."
swe.105.a:0 "Karl Kilblom of the Radical Socialists win."
swe.105.b:0 "Karin Boye of the Radical Socialists win."

### Fire Once Events ###

swe.11.t:0 "Dark secret exposed!"
swe.11.d:0 "As it is in the interest of our current party leader to gain full control of Sweden, our agents were sent out to discover any secrets we could on important people in our nation. They hardly believed their eyes when they found reports of the King of Sweden, Gustav V Bernadotte, has an affair with a man! \n\nHis partner is a rouge-ish type called Kurt Haijby, and the royal household is regularly offering him and his wife bribe money to stay silent. Should this leak the monarchy might just come to an end...!"
swe.11.a:0 "This is just the chance we have been waiting for. Goodbye Kingdom of Sweden!"
swe.11.b:0 "Make sure this man goes missing... This scandal will never reach the public."

swe.12.t:0 "Karin Boye releases För Lite."
swe.12.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and her new novel is a success."
swe.12.a:0 "I shall have to read it sometime."

swe.13.t:0 "Greta Garbo stars in Camille."
swe.13.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe.13.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe.13.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe.14.t:0 "Five year commemoration of Ådalen"
swe.14.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe.14.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe.14.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe.15.t:0 "Final sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe.15.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''. \n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe.15.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe.15.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe.16.t:0 "Manhunter on the loose!"
swe.16.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe.16.a:0 "What have I done?!"

swe.17.t:0 "Major Hotel Strike!"
swe.17.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protesters violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe.17.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe.17.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe.17.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe.18.t:0 "City massacre"
swe.18.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protesters were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe.18.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe.19.t:0 "The hotel strike ends"
swe.19.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."
swe.19.a:0 "Thank Goodness!"

swe.20.t:0 "Funeral of Gösta Ekman"
swe.20.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe.20.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe.21.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the radio"
swe.21.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe.21.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe.22.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe.22.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe.22.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe.22.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe.23.t:0 "Garbo skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe.23.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tongue-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe.23.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe.23.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe.24.t:0 "Kallocain released"
swe.24.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where criticising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe.24.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe.24.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe.25.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe.25.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. The poet and author was known for her emotional instability, in particular over the last few months. Even more so perhaps since one of the the women she loved, Anita Nathorst, was dying of cancer. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much."
swe.25.a:0 "Visst gör det ont när knopparna brister..."

swe.26.t:0 "IKEA founded"
swe.26.d:0 "The other day a seventeen year old lad named Ingvar Kamprad founded a small company for selling everything from pencils and fishing tools, to stockings and belts. It is run from his parent's private farm as a mail order company and appearently he will personally bike out to your home and deliver the goods to your front door."
swe.26.a:0 "Seems like an ambitious young man."

swe.27.t:0 "New Malmö Theatre opens"
swe.27.d:0 "The recently opened Malmö City Theatre is one of the largest theatres in Europe, and offers and impressive display indeed. For the opening night it will show the classic of 'A midsummer night's dream', the Shakespear classic."
swe.27.a:0 "Get me a ticket!"

swe.28.t:0 "Arvid Lindman passes away"
swe.28.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."
swe.28.a:0 "A great statesman is gone"

swe.29.t:0 "Arvid Lindman is dead"
swe.29.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."
swe.29.a:0 "A great tyrant is gone"

swe.30.t:0 "Sweden hit by Black Monday"
swe.30.d:0 "When the German market collapsed a few days ago Sweden felt the waves come crashing. Initially there was a small blow but it seemed to stabilise quickly enough... And then it all came crashing down too. After the Weltkrieg Sweden became heavily dependent on Swedish-German trade, either directly with Germany or with their puppet states among the Baltic sea. We'll have to perform several industrial reforms to recover from this!"
swe.30.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

swe.31.t:0 "Sweden recovers from Black Monday"
swe.31.d:0 "After a long time of hard and extensive reforms, we have managed to recover from the backlash of the German Black Monday economic crash. While there might still be scars in our society after the blow, we have healed. Swedish economy is back up and running."
swe.31.a:0 "Thank goodness!"

swe.32.t:0 "Valkyriorna formed"
swe.32.d:0 "Shortly after our decision to allow women into the military, stunt-pilot Elsa Andersson, known for her daring parachuting in the twenties, have requested to form a women's only air brigade. The project have adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient Norse mythology who oversaw the slain left on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden."
swe.32.a:0 "Isn't there a song about something like this?"

swe.33.t:0 "Åland integration"
swe.33.d:0 "With Åland back into our hands the local populace is cheering wildly. In their hearts, they have always been Swedes, and although it lacks any large population and industry, it still feels good knowing that our people live under the flag of their choosing."
swe.33.a:0 "Åland is ours at last!"

swe.34.t:0 "Vaasa integration"
swe.34.d:0 "With Vaasa finally back into Swedish hands the Swedes are coming out of the woodwork, raising Swedish flags up high. Although there's a small Finnish minority living here, the grand majority of the populace are without a doubt exalted to see the Swedish flag high!"
swe.34.a:0 "Finally!"

swe.35.t:0 "Nyland in Swedish hands!"
swe.35.d:0 "Finally, the richest region of Finland is finally Swedish once more. Even though there's a large Finnish population living here, with Helsinfors being the former capital of Finland, they will without a doubt learn to love their Swedish rulers."
swe.35.a:0 "Excellent!"

swe.36.t:0 "Oslo integration"
swe.36.d:0 "While the Norwegians are fiercely independent and struggled for a long time to gain freedom from Sweden it didn't last very long. The Swedish flag is flying high in Oslo, and with the Swedish language being promoted on all work-places it won't be long until we have properly integrated the richest region of Norway."
swe.36.a:0 "Perfect!"

swe.37.t:0 "Köpenhamn integration"
swe.37.d:0 "With Köpenhamn in Swedish control it won't take long until we teach the Danish how to talk and act properly. With the richest region of Denmark fully integrated, Sweden will be stronger than ever before!"
swe.37.a:0 "Perhaps we should build a bridge?"

swe.38.t:0 "War interrupts trade"
swe.38.d:0 "As a war broke out in between Sweden and Germany, our lucrative iron trade has broken down. We'll no longer benefit from prior trade agreements."
swe.38.a:0 "Curses!"

### Repeated Events ###
swe.221.t:0 "Our King holds public ceremony"
swe.221.d:0 "Our most Kingly monarch has participated in a public ceremony, promoting the ideas of a strong Swedish monarchy and church. He was seen waving to the crowds with his sons present, and his speech was delivered live to the whole nation via radio."
swe.221.a:0 "How Kingly of him."
