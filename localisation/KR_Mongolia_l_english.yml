### Events ###
mongolia.1.t:0 "The Russians Aren't Watching"
mongolia.1.d:0 "Only a few days have passed since the assassination of Kerensky, and Russia is still trying to regroup and reorganise. They would be too busy in their own affairs to notice much if we laid the groundwork for reclaiming our proper lands from our Chinese neighbours..."
mongolia.1.a:0 "Stake our claims on the recognised Mongol lands!"
mongolia.1.b:0 "The Chinese be Damned! Unification for ALL the Mongolians!"
mongolia.1.c:0 "It's not worth the risk"
mongolia.2.t:0 "An Alliance With Tibet?"
mongolia.2.d:0 "There has been an increased interest in our neighbours, and some people in government are calling to send a political envoy to Tibet, as they hold a strategic position in relation to our enemies in the south. Unity with these fellow Buddhists could come handy in the near future..."
mongolia.2.a:0 "Send the Envoy!"
mongolia.2.b:0 "What do they have but yaks? Leave them be."
mongolia.3.t:0 "A Mongol Envoy Arrives"
mongolia.3.d:0 "Our fellow Buddhists from across the Muslim lands in Mongolia have sent a diplomatic envoy. They seek cooperation and unity between our groups... how should we respond?"
mongolia.3.a:0 "Welcome the Envoy! Unity for Historical Tibet!"
mongolia.3.b:0 "We are a humble people - politely refuse."
mongolia.4.t:0 "Tibet accepts our Offer"
mongolia.4.d:0 "Tibet accepts our alliance. We will now work together to spread the word of Buddha."
mongolia.4.a:0 "Great News!"
mongolia.5.t:0 "Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan and the Mongol Minority"
mongolia.5.d:0 "After we have laid claim to the region of Inner Mongolia, the True Mongols in Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan have begun fighting the Hui government."
mongolia.5.a:0 "Send in troops to aid our brothers!"
mongolia.5.b:0 "This is not the time"
mongolia.6.t:0 "Ethnic Skirmishes on the Frontier"
mongolia.6.d:0 "After Mongolia officially claimed its right over the Mongol-dominated territories on the frontier, there has been local unrest against us in these regions. To make matters worse, Sternberg has been sending troops to aid the partisans. The government should act soon, as the revolts get more violent by the day, and there is little room for diplomacy with revolts so close to our major cities."
mongolia.6.a:0 "We shall not stand for this lack of respect! To arms!"
mongolia.6.b:0 "Enough blood has been shed. Submit to Sternberg and the Mongols."
mongolia.7.t:0 "Ungern Khan Descends Upon Xinjiang"
mongolia.7.d:0 "The Mad Baron has unleashed his Asiatic Cavalry Division on the steppes of the northwest, sending panic through the stumbling forces of the Ma clique. An outright counter invasion from our mountain fortresses seems thoroughly dangerous, but we may with stealth and forgery usurp power in the lowland province of Lanzhou, improving our defences tenfold by securing the western banks of the Yellow River entirely."
mongolia.7.a:0 "Lanzhou shall be the western gate of the Millenarian state!"
mongolia.7.b:0 "The Pure Kingdom Upon the Heavens shall remain neutral"
mongolia.8.t:0 "Vultures from Xa'an"
mongolia.8.d:0 "Disaster! The Millenarian fanatics on our eastern border have descended from the mountains of Shanxi and seized control of the town of Lanzhou. With the addition of the I-Kuan Tao, we face enemies from all sides, can we afford to lose one city if we in turn win the war?"
mongolia.8.a:0 "When the Mongol has been chastised, we shall level Mount Heng!"
mongolia.8.b:0 "Vermin, your time shall come... in due time!"
mongolia.9.t:0 "The Muslims Submit!"
mongolia.9.d:0 "The Muslims to the south have submitted without a fight!"
mongolia.9.a:0 "Huzzah!"
mongolia.10.t:0 "Land transfer"
mongolia.10.d:0 "We have been forced to cede some of our provinces to Tibet."
mongolia.10.a:0 "We have to comply"
mongolia.11.t:0 "Victory in Xibei Lianbang Yiyuan"
mongolia.11.d:0 "After great fighting, we have at last subdued the Western Warlords! There is much to reward ourselves and soldiers here,including captured enemy supplies. How should the new populace, and these resources, be dealt with?"
mongolia.11.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.11.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."
mongolia.12.t:0 "Mongol Rule in Xinjiang, Qinghai and Gangsu"
mongolia.12.d:0 "After a period of consolidation, Ungern Khan has decided to cement his rule over the Chinese provinces formerly held by the criminally corrupt Ma family. This could be done either by setting up territoriality maimed puppet states or by integrating the populace into Mongolia proper."
mongolia.12.a:0 "Set up an Uighur puppet state in outer Xinjiang."
mongolia.12.b:0 "Partition the provinces into tributary states!"
mongolia.12.c:0 "All three provinces shall be ruled from Urga!"
mongolia.13.t:0 "Independent Uighuria"
mongolia.13.d:0 "They're not right in the head those crazy Mongols."
mongolia.13.a:0 "Gah."
mongolia.14.t:0 "War in Central Asia!"
mongolia.14.d:0 "On our western border, the Turks have engaged in a bloody conflict! How shall we react to such news?"
mongolia.14.a:0 "Join our Kazakh brothers in their fight!"
mongolia.14.b:0 "We sympathise with the Turks... rally the hordes!"
mongolia.14.c:0 "Central Asia is a waste of resources."
mongolia.15.t:0 "Mongol Allies"
mongolia.15.d:0 "The Mongols, hearing of our war, have asked to join us in our Holy War. They will be a strong ally, but the Baron is a tricky fellow. Should we encourage this alliance?"
mongolia.15.a:0 "Welcome our Altaic brothers!"
mongolia.15.b:0 "Turn those tricky Mongols back home... This is OUR war!"
mongolia.16.t:0 "Mongol-Turkic Alliance"
mongolia.16.d:0 "The Turks have accepted our alliance!"
mongolia.16.a:0 "Huzzah!"
mongolia.17.t:0 "Mongol-Turkic Alliance Denied!"
mongolia.17.d:0 "The Turks have refused our offer of alliance. How should we react to this slight?"
mongolia.17.a:0 "Offer assistance for the Kazakhs instead."
mongolia.17.b:0 "Allies be damned, attack the Turks!"
mongolia.17.c:0 "Central Asia is a waste of resources after all..."
mongolia.18.t:0 "Alma-Ata has Fallen!"
mongolia.18.d:0 "The stronghold of Alma-Ata has fallen! We have the opportunity to punish the rebellious populous, and gain loot for our victorious hordes!"
mongolia.18.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.18.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully"
mongolia.19.t:0 "Mongol Allies"
mongolia.19.d:0 "The Mongols, hearing of our war, have asked to join us in our war against the Turks. They will be a strong ally with troops we need, but the Baron harbours similar radicalism. Should we encourage this alliance?"
mongolia.19.a:0 "Welcome our Altaic brothers!"
mongolia.19.b:0 "Refuse the Mongol intervention."
mongolia.20.t:0 "Mongol-Kazakh Alliance"
mongolia.20.d:0 "The Kazakhs have accepted our alliance!"

mongolia.22.a:0 "Welcome our Altaic brothers!"
mongolia.22.b:0 "Refuse the Mongol intervention."
mongolia.23.t:0 "Mongol-Kazakh Alliance Denied!"

mongolia.25.a:0 "AStrike at the Turks."
mongolia.25.b:0 "Attack both parties!"
mongolia.25.c:0 "Central Asia is a waste of resources after all..."
mongolia.26.t:0 "The Need for Natural Resources"
mongolia.26.d:0 "One major setback facing Mongolia is our lack of natural resources. The government may need to focus its policies on resources."
mongolia.26.a:0 "Yes, we need resources, they are essential."
mongolia.26.b:0 "No Change in Policy is Needed"
mongolia.27.t:0 "The Khem-Beldyr Natural Resources"
mongolia.27.d:0 "Many government advisers are supporting expanding mining operations in the province of Khem-Beldyr to mine the areas rich with natural resources. It would give us the ability to expand our industry further and help speed up our industrialisation."
mongolia.27.a:0 "We need the resources! Expand mining operations!"
mongolia.27.b:0 "Mining Operations in Khem-Beldyr are not worth the effort, we will make due"
mongolia.28.t:0 "The Newfound Resources"
mongolia.28.d:0 "The investment placed into mining the province of Khem-Beldyr have paid off. The resources gained will soon make more than their original cost."
mongolia.28.a:0 "Why Didn't We think of this Earlier?!"
mongolia.29.t:0 "NOT VISIBLE"
mongolia.29.d:0 "NOT VISIBLE"
mongolia.29.a:0 "NOT VISIBLE"
mongolia.30.t:0 "The Qing have been Defeated"
mongolia.30.d:0 "The Mongols have taken the Qing major cities, and the Emperor is now at our mercy."
mongolia.30.a:0 "The Qing Will Rule China For Us!"
mongolia.30.b:0 "We will occupy the territory our-self!"
mongolia.31.t:0 "The Status of the Shangqing Tiango"
mongolia.31.d:0 "The territory of the former Shangqing Tiango is under our control, but the Qing may be able to better administrate the region."
mongolia.31.a:0 "Transfer the Territory to the Qing"
mongolia.31.b:0 "There is no need to transfer the territory"
mongolia.32.t:0 "A New Mongolian Empire?"
mongolia.32.d:0 "Now that our cowardly enemies are defeated nobody can stop our Khan from restoring the past glory of Mongolia. With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"
mongolia.32.a:0 "Mongolia will rise again under Ungern Khan!"
mongolia.32.b:0 "We must focus on developing the Pan-Mongolian State!"
mongolia.33.t:0 "Death of von Ungern-Sternberg"
mongolia.33.d:0 "A ruthless dictator, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."
mongolia.33.a:0 "The military takes direct of the country"
mongolia.33.b:0 "Religious leaders assume control over the country."
mongolia.34.t:0 "Death of Genghis Khan II"
mongolia.34.d:0 "A ruthless autocrat, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling.

However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan, Genghis Khan's reincarnation, came to an end. The new era of Mongolia has begun - but there is still the question about the future of this era. Some conspirators want to rule the country behind the back of new monarch - Ungern's wife or his little son, while some of them want to form a military government. Mongolia is at the crossroads of history once again."
mongolia.34.a:0 "Zhelne Khatun shall rule the country. Under supervision..."
mongolia.34.b:0 "Genghis Khan III shall rule. Under supervision..."
mongolia.34.c:0 "Military takes direct control of the country"
mongolia.35.t:0 "A Second in Command for Ungern Khan?"
mongolia.35.d:0 "Today newspapers around the world has been filled with the news of the assassination of the Russian president, Alexander Kerensky. Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"
mongolia.35.a:0 "Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man!"
mongolia.35.b:0 "Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, the Mongol noble!"
mongolia.35.c:0 "The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, the pious holy man!"
mongolia.36.t:0 "Annexation of Shangtian"
mongolia.36.d:0 "After hard fighting, we have at last subdued this pathetic Shangqing regime! The Khan is pleased with our victories that glorified his rule and made our beloved Mongolia much stronger and larger. There is much to reward ourselves and soldiers here,including captured enemy supplies. How should the new populace, and these resources, be dealt with?"
mongolia.36.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.36.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."
mongolia.37.t:0 "Annexation of Tibet"
mongolia.37.d:0 "Tibet is now under hooves of our horses...But we should remember our long friendship and cooperation with this people. Their government will be punished for their betrayal, but citizens of Tibetan mountains will probably agree to join our Empire under the rule of glorious Genghis Khan II! Tibetans know how to fight in the ice hills, and their soldiers will be beneficial to our mighty armies...But warriors of the Khan want to be rewarded for long bloody battles..."
mongolia.37.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.37.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."
mongolia.38.t:0 "Dealing with the Lhasa Regime"
mongolia.38.d:0 "Tibet always enjoyed cordial relations with Mongolia, but once they heard about the restoration of our Great Empire, the cowardly government in Lhasa turned their back upon Ungern. The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."

mongolia.39.d:0 "With Xinjiang and Tibet incorporated into our Empire we have one more enemy to beat – the Millenarian state of the Shangqing Tianguo, where a lot of Mongolic tribes live under Chinese oppression. Nomadic peoples want to recognise Genghis Khan II as their one and only ruler - that means that war is unavoidable. Soon the banner of Ungern Khan and the restore Mongol Empire!"
mongolia.39.a:0 "The God of War Reincarnated shall ravage Yan'an!"
mongolia.39.b:0 "It'd be a far too Long March..."
mongolia.40.t:0 "Tribal Revolt!"
mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him ‘Ak Bagatur' – ‘The White Warrior. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army (which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility). Leaders of the Mongol tribes under command of noyan (aristocratic title for tribe leaders) Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressor's". Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes..."
mongolia.40.a:0 "The rebellious tribes topples the regime!"
mongolia.40.b:0 "The tribal revolt is crushed!"
mongolia.42.t:0 "Bringing Down the Yunnan Warlords"
mongolia.42.d:0 "With Xinjiang,Tibet and Shangmongolia incorporated into our Empire we have one more enemy to beat – the rebel state of the Yunnan Warlords, these lands once belonged to the Mongol Empire and they will at the end be ruled once more by us, they're rightful owners."
mongolia.42.a:0 "The God of War Reincarnated shall ravage Yunnan!"
mongolia.42.b:0 "It'd be a far too Long March..."
mongolia.43.t:0 "Puppet Yunnan"

mongolia.44.d:0 "NOT VISIBLE"
mongolia.44.a:0 "NOT VISIBLE"
mongolia.45.t:0 "German territories"
mongolia.45.d:0 "Maybe it's time to deal with the last enemies in China, Germany. Now that we don't have any equal enemies China don't need the Kaiser's help anymore."
mongolia.45.a:0 "It's the time!"
mongolia.45.b:0 "That would be not nice from us"
mongolia.46.t:0 "The Mongolians are moving troops into our ports!"
mongolia.46.d:0 "Last night the Mongolian Empire moved troops across the border into our cities along the coast! They are claiming ownership and demanding that we back down before they invade Indochina!"
mongolia.46.a:0 "We cannot afford a war halfway around the world"
mongolia.46.b:0 "The Kaiser will not stand for this INSULT!"
mongolia.47.t:0 "Germany accepts"
mongolia.47.d:0 "Germany accepted our demands and gave back our rightful territories. It's an important step to reunite the Mongol Empire under the rule of the glorious Von Sternberg dynasty."
mongolia.47.a:0 "Welcome home"
mongolia.48.t:0 "Status of Macau"
mongolia.48.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macau became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Now that the South lies in the hands of the Mongolians once more, the khan is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Mongols."
mongolia.48.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
mongolia.48.b:0 "Let the idea slide"
mongolia.49.t:0 "Mongol Demands"
mongolia.49.d:0 "After centuries, the Mongol Khan now decided to demand Macau from us. The Mongol Empire is now one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them is probably not a good idea."
mongolia.49.a:0 "We have no choice."
mongolia.49.b:0 "They will have to fight for it!"
