### Focuses ###
CHL_air:0 "Update Airforce Philosophy"
CHL_air_desc:0 "Our airdoctrines are still a relic of the time of earlu aviation, and what was once cutting edge now belongs in a museum. Our pilots and planning will be updated accordingly"
CHL_air2:0 "Aerial Production"
CHL_air2_desc:0 "The sudden cut of funding for the Airforce is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for. Thankfully, we have comrades from the Union of Britain who can me most helpful in this endeavour"
CHL_fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
CHL_fighter2:0 "Close Air Support Craft" #CAS
CHL_fighter3:0 "Long Range Aircraft Experiments" #long range aircraft
CHL_fighter_desc:0 "Aerial supremacy is key in modern war, of that few can doubt; But the advent of new mechanisms of war means that our old biplanes are not suitable for defending the skies of Chile anymore"
CHL_fighter2_desc:0 "Air superiority could be meaningless if we cannot capitalise in help for our troops on the frontlines; not only special aircraft is required, but specific training too"
CHL_fighter3_desc:0 "Our country is, from an strategical standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Airforce has planes capable of long autonomous flights"
CHL_airdoc:0 "Aerial Strategy"
CHL_airdoc2_desc:0 "The engagements themselves are also to be analysed, and our few planes cannot be foolishly thrown away. Careful studying and manoeuvres will be key in our coming victory"
CHL_airdoc_desc:0 "Aerial engagements are quick and brutal affairs; and it pays to plan for them and strategic missions beforehand. What will be the focus of our airforce in the war to come, our General Staff must decide"
CHL_airdoc2:0 "Aerial Tactics"
CHL_bomber:0 "Bomber Effort"
CHL_bomber_desc:0 "The role of a Bomber Craft is somewhat new, but it's uses were made apparent many times. In order to make sure we can defend the Fatherland, our Weltkrieg era models will have to be replaced"
CHL_bomber2:0 "Modern Bomber Craft"
CHL_bomber2_desc:0 "Not only as to make Bombers an active, modernise part of our airforce, but to also make sure they are up to date, we will continue investing on different, role based Bomber Craft!
CHL_navy:0 "Sovereign of the Pacific"
CHL_navy_desc:0 "Our fleet, with it's recent additions and investments in the term of Chariman Puga, is perhaps the most powerful in South America; it is most certainly the most well armed fighting force of the south pacific, and well capable of both defensive and offensive operations"
CHL_highseas:0 "A High Seas Navy"
CHL_highseas_desc:0 "The decisive battles of the wars to come will be fought on deep waters, away from coastal support. In order to make sure our navy is ready for this crucial engagement against a certain undisclosed enemy to the West, we will make drills, exercises and planning efforts"
CHL_dockyard:0 "Fleet Renewal"
CHL_dockyard_desc:0 "Our fleet, while well armed and well supplied, has many second hand or outdated vessels; If we are to modernise it, we must spare no expense in dockyards, shipyards and weapon systems"
CHL_carry2:0 "Aircraft Carrier Effort"
CHL_carry2_carry:0 "Many experts believe in the importance of Aircraft carriers in a naval engagement; this is  especially true in our Republic, given how a great many influential staff members have an Airforce background. While monumentally expensive, a modern aircraft carrier might mean the difference between victory and defeat"
CHL_cafi:0 "Naval Strike Aircraft"
CHL_cafi_desc:0 "Naval Aircraft has always been a key factor of national defence; most of our important military centres are within range of Naval Artillery. It's a matter of the utmost importance, to ensure we can defend our coastline from foreign aggression"

CHL_hc_desc:0 "Cruisers are a mainstay of our navy, but they are all of outdated models and specifications, despite out buildup efforts. Technological improvements are in order"

CHL_bb:0 "Commission more Battleships"
CHL_bb_desc:0 "The Almirante Latorre class battleship is a fine vessel, but one that shows it's age, even with the small upgrades we outfitted. We will likely require a new flagship to ensure our national security"
CHL_highseas2:0 "Blue Water Navy"
CHL_highseas2_desc:0 "Even more emphasis on Deep Water tactics, doctrines and manoeuvres will be required if our navy is to have against chance against it's enemies. Patrice makes perfect"
CHL_sub:0 "Submarine Ventures"

CHL_des:0 "Anti Submarine Effort"
CHL_des_desc:0 "Our efforts to hunt down enemy submarines may end fruitless if our smaller ships are not modern enough, putting both our flagships and our shipping lanes at risk. We must not allow that to happen"

CHL_ls_desc:0 "Even if our navy is among the most powerful of the South, Imperialist forces from Germany, the United States and La Plata could possibly make us have to rely on asymmetrical naval warfare, in order to compensate for our lack of tonnage and manpower."
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution:0 "A Nation Under Siege"
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The biggest danger to Chile is not internal, but that of the fearsome Union of La Plata, who recently annexed Paraguay and Uruguay in brutal and opportunistic fashion. They do little to hide their ambitions on our territory since the birth of their nation in the 1800s, and now, emboldened by Brazilian incompetence, wish to see Chile conquered. We will not let happen!"
CHL_mobility_potential:0 "Mobility Potential"
CHL_mobility_potential_desc:0 "Many have heard ideas and plans about how modern warfare will be a fast-paced, mechanised affair; even if that may not turn out to be the case, we do not have the manpower to engage in traditional war with La Plata and the other Imperialists. We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces"
CHL_communard_expertise:0 "Communard Expertise"
CHL_communard_expertise_desc:0 "France's Doctrine of Aggression has many strong proponents, and they may be of great use to our cause, especially since among them are advisers and officers who are eager to be on the frontlines of the war against Imperialism"
CHL_tanque:0 "Tank Effort"
CHL_tanque_desc:0 "Our military requires not only tanks, but tanks that are modern, autonomous and can deal with the harsh terrain of our homeland. Advanced war machinery may mean the difference between victory and defeat"
CHL_tanque2:0 "Tank Production Effort"
CHL_tanque2_desc:0 "We cannot mechanise our forces properly with simple imports; we must ensure our factories can supply our armed forces by themselves, for we cannot depend on other nations on such vital matters"
CHL_infantry:0 "Army Rearmament"
CHL_infantry_desc:0 "While the army is not underpaid or underfed as it used to be before the Revolution, it is still poorly equipped. Let us attend to the needs of our officers and ensure our Army can fight off any threats"

CHL_art_desc:0 "Our Artillery is in dire need of renewal; the battlefields of the Weltkrieg and the Platine War standing as witnesses. Only with newer models we can stand a chance against the Aggressor to the West"
CHL_infeq2:0 "Modern Military Equipment"
CHL_infeq2_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, the equipment in our military is not entirely up to modern standards. Our officers will require more spending and attention from our government, but the vanguard of the revolution deserves only the best!"
CHL_arty2:0 "Firepower Effort"
CHL_arty2_:0 "We indeed require more accurate, well armed artillery pieces if we are to ensure the survival of our nation. Now, specialised guns, we will be able to rain fire upon the enemy!"

CHL_mountaineers:0 "Mountaineer Brigade Expansion"
CHL_mountaineers_desc:0 "The Mountains that surround us are an integral part of any national defence plan in case of invasion. Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life"
CHL_andean_strategy:0 "Andean Strategy"
CHL_andean_strategy_desc:0 "The so called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if La Plata overpowers us and crossed the Andes. The rough terrain near and around Santiago will be made impenetrable to foreign invaders, which will allow us to resist even the harshest numerical disadvantage"
CHL_long_term_planning:0 "Long Term Planning"
CHL_long_term_planning_desc:0 "Not only battles and combat engagements are important, but the very movement and organisation of both our forces and that of our enemies will be thoroughly studied, and prepare our general staff for the challenge of the coming War of Imperialism"

CHL_doctrine_offense:0 "Offensive Doctrine"

CHL_drilled_military:0 "Renew Strict Drill Standards"
CHL_drilled_military_desc:0 "Chile's military was once known as the 'South Prussia', and its performance and discipline were the envy of all. Now, with it's role as the vanguard of the people fulfilled, it can turn it's gaze upon those would hurt our countrymen, and the ideas we stand for"
CHL_the_third_chairman:0 "The Third Chairman"

CHL_total:0 "Labarca and the Totalist Faction"
CHL_total_desc:0 "Labarca and the Mosleyists know that only a strong government can keep Chile safe against it's many enemies. The people now are safe!"
CHL_permanet:0 "Permanent Revolution Doctrine"
CHL_permanet_desc:0 "Something that Labarcists defend, the idea that the Revolution can only be maintained by force, for reactionary elements cannot be reasoned or bargained with. The Proletarian Dictatorship will be permanent until it's not longer necessary"
CHL_directrule:0 "Centralised Planning"
CHL_directrule_desc:0 "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worse"
CHL_chairmanmega:0 "Extend Chairman's Powers"
CHL_chairmanmega_desc:0 "The Chairman still requires approval from the Syndicalist Congress for many actions, something that greatly cripples the capacity of our state to react. We must change this!"
CHL_commisariats:0 "Revolutionary Commissars"
CHL_commisariats_desc:0 "Now, we can have appointed officers in army units and factories, ensuring both loyalty and hard work at all times, for an idle mind is an invitation to counter-revolution"

CHL_clean:0 "A Totalist Government"
CHL_clean_desc:0 "Totalism implies total loyalty, and total devotion to the revolutionary ideals we hold on to so dearly, no matter the cost. 'Moderates' have no place anywhere near serious decision making"
CHL_getcounterrev:0 "Ensure Officer Loyalty"
CHL_getcounterrev_desc:0 "Many officers are still traditionalist and archaic, who might as well be theocrats with their sad devotion to ancient religions. But their priests did not grant them clairvoyance to conjure up an escape from the Revolutionary Courts!"
CHL_helicopter_rides:0 "Dealing with Traitors"
CHL_helicopter_rides_desc:0 "Some individuals still cling to counterrevolutionary ideals, and would never let them go. There is a place where they can keep said ideas: The Easter Island. Of course, bad things always happen in such long trips..."

CHL_cement_congresses_desc:0 "The Congress of Syndicates is still somewhat unknown by the workers; many just call it Senate out of habit. We will ensure that it's members, decisions and achievements are well know by the populace"
CHL_extended:0 "Extend CSC Powers"
CHL_cement_congresses_desc:0 "The Congress of Syndicates is now a true house of democracy, unlike the parliament of the Old Republic. However, it is still quite powerless in many matters, a relic of our over-centralising presidentialist past. We must remedy this!"
CHL_autonomous_councils:0 "Autonomous Councils"

CHL_tackle_unemployment_desc:0 "Many in Chile's cities are not fully contributing to society, for the lack of industries is still a problem we must address as soon as possible"

### Events ###
chl.1.t:0 "Earthquake in Chile"
chl.1.d:0 "An earthquake in Chile killed 30.000 people and thousands of people are left homeless. We should do something to help them."
chl.1.a:0 "Help the survivors!"
chl.1.b:0 "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of these unlucky few"
chl.2.t:0 "The Third Chairman"
chl.2.d:0 "Our young republic now holds it's second central elections; much fanfare and celebration is held, and 3 main candidates attempt to sway the votes of the workers. Blest Riffo, a long time fighter of worker's rights during the worst times of repression, is favoured both by Marmaduke and most of the mainline Syndicalists, and thus the majority of voters. Against him runs the young Salvador Allende, whose very opposition broad coalition us as diverse as it is rather uncoheisive, but they promise a better future for Chile. Also, with rather diminute chances, the Totalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists like Mosley and Beira, are running with Labarca as their frontman. What will the people decide?"
chl.2.a:0 "Clotario Blest Riffo and the Orthodox Syndicalists"
chl.2.b:0 "Salvador Allende and the Social Coalition"
chl.2.c:0 "Carlos Labarca and the Mosleyists"
chl.3.t:0 "Chile in 1936"
chl.3.d:0 "After the Saltpetre War 1879 - 1883 in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpetre provinces Tarapacá and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolised the world trade in saltpetre. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the of arrival of reinforcements from the long exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Syndicalist Republic of Chile was proclaimed. After 5 years of rebuilding under the first council, led at least nominally by Arturo Puga, the republic economy recovered greatly, and a military build-up has begun after the Platine War. Now, with La Plata's rhetoric becoming increasingly aggressive, the well respected Marmaduke Grove, military man veteran of two revolutions oceans apart, is at the helm of the rebuilding you republic. However, not all Chileans are as hopeful for the future as the syndical leaders are..."
chl.3.a:0 "The Light of Syndicalism will guide us to the future, whatever it may hold"
chl.4.t:0 "The Fourth Chairman"
chl.4.d:0 "After 10 years of a stable government, the people of Chile rejoice at the prosperity and peace the revolution brought. And now comes the time to elect the Fourth Chairman of the Chilean Syndicalist Republic. Four candidates are running the ballot, and 3 of them are respected and well regarded poets and writers. Gabriela Mistral leads the Pacto de Calais, a broad coalition of intellectuals and politicians who defend the Republic's central government, but unlike Pablo de Rokha's Totalists, do see regular elections and personal freedoms as of something of the utmost importance. The Orthodox Syndicalists are led by Pablo Neruda, yet another very accomplished writer and poet. Meanwhile, the broad Social Front led by Aurelio Celedon Palma has gained some momentum, especially with the rise of autonomist sentiments in the southern half of the nation. But who will win the Poet's Brawl, as the press likes calling this heated contest?"
chl.4.a:0 "Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga, better known as Gabriela Mistral, and the Heterodox Syndicalists"
chl.4.b:0 "Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí, better known as Pablo Neruda, and the Orthodox Syndicalists"
chl.4.c:0 "Aurelio Celedon Palma, the militaryman, and the Social Front"
chl.4.e:0 "Carlos Díaz Loyola, better known as Pablo de Rokha and the Mosleyists"
chl.ally.1.t:0 "Chile wishes to join the Internationale"
chl.ally.1.d:0 "The workers revolution in Chile has been greatly successful, a shining model in the Southern Hemisphere of revolutionary ideals. However, they feel threatened by reactionary neighbours and other imperialist threats, and feel like it's high time to join the Internationale"
chl.ally.1.a:0 "Let us welcome then in the struggle for World Revolution!"
chl.ally.1.b:0 "That is pointless!"
chl.ally.2.t:0 "Chile wishes to join our Alliance"
chl.ally.2.d:0 "Chile's revolutionary government has shifted it's stance to one that aligns with local syndicalist regimes after their elections, and thus they naturally came to us, asking for a military alliance"
chl.ally.2.a:0 "The end of the La Plata union is just the beginning! Avante!"
chl.ally.2.b:0 "That is pointless!"
