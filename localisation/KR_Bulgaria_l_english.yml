### Events ###

bulgaria.0.t:0 "The Tsardom of Bulgaria"
bulgaria.0.d:0 "Bulgaria won her independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 with the Treaty of San Stefano, but was even then cut down by the Berlin Congress. Becoming the driving force behind the Balkan League and carrying much of the burden in the First Balkan War, Bulgaria was once more betrayed and cut down by her former allies, Greece and Serbia. It was only in the Weltkrieg that the Bulgarian state came to control all that which was rightfully hers; King Ferdinand had chosen right and his vision finally seemed to be reality. All was not truly perfect however; unrest in the newly conquered provinces, subversive nationalist propaganda campaigns by neighbours and a stagnant economy caused Bulgaria to falter and fail to make full use of their newfound power, even despite German industrial assistance. Tsar Ferdinand abdicated earlier this decade, leaving the throne to his son Tsar Boris the Third."
bulgaria.0.a:0 "Glory to Bulgaria and the Tsar!"

bulgaria.1.t:0 "Liberation Day"
bulgaria.1.d:0 "The Third of March marks Liberation Day - when years ago at the Treaty of San Stefano we won our independence from the Ottoman Turks. The whole country celebrates and the streets of Sofia fill with waving flags!"
bulgaria.1.a:0 "God is with us!"

bulgaria.2.t:0 "Liberation Day"

bulgaria.3.t:0 "Black Monday hits Bulgaria!"
bulgaria.3.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached the Tsardom of Bulgaria. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Bulgarian lev is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our own export orientated economy is on the verge of collapse..."
bulgaria.3.a:0 "Intervene to aid economic recovery"

bulgaria.4.t:0 "John Atanasov"
bulgaria.4.d:0 "American-born Bulgarian scientist John Atanasov asks for shelter after escaping the civil war which ravages America. He said that the ongoing civil war prevented him from progressing further in his work on creating a computer calculating machine. Should we accept him?"
bulgaria.4.a:0 "Welcome home!"
bulgaria.4.b:0 "You're not welcome here!"

bulgaria.5.t:0 "Ottoman Empire in disarray"
bulgaria.5.d:0 "With the Ottoman Empire in turmoil, we have a great opportunity to seize control of Eastern Thrace, without any kind of open warfare. Part of our general staff and the more nationalistic politicians are arguing that we could instead seize the entire European part of the Ottoman Empire, but doing such will surely anger them as they would rather die than surrender their capital to us."
bulgaria.5.a:0 "Seize control of Adrianople!"
bulgaria.5.b:0 "Seize control of Constantinople!"
bulgaria.5.c:0 "Seize control of neither!"

bulgaria.6.t:0 "Bulgaria takes control of Adrianople!"
bulgaria.6.d:0 "With our empire in chaos, Bulgaria has taken the opportunity to seize control of Eastern Thrace. Bulgarian units are already advancing on Adrianople and there is very little we can do to stop Bulgaria at this point..."
bulgaria.6.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
bulgaria.6.b:0 "This means WAR!"

bulgaria.7.t:0 "Bulgarian advance on Konstantinyye"
bulgaria.7.d:0 "With our empire in chaos, Bulgaria has decided to use this opportunity to seize control of the entire European part of our Empire, including Konstantinyye! Despite critical situations on other fronts, our population is steadfast that we must defend our capital and resist the Bulgarian invaders!"
bulgaria.7.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
bulgaria.7.b:0 "This means WAR!"

bulgaria.8.t:0 "Political Scandal"
bulgaria.8.d:0 "The eccentric and outspoken former Tsar Ferdinand has complained that his already considerable 'pensions' are insufficient for a man of his stature. Prime Minister Filov refused Ferdinand's demands outright, claiming that such extravagance was tasteless in a country suffering from economic depression. Tsar Boris has the ungrateful task of choosing between his father and his Prime Minister. Who will the Tsar support?"
bulgaria.8.a:0 "Support Ferdinand, Bulgaria will honour its heroes"
bulgaria.8.b:0 "Support Filov, Ferdinand demands too much"

bulgaria.9.t:0 "Filov's Choice"
bulgaria.9.d:0 "The Tsar chose to support his father in his demands for a higher pension. The Tsar's intervention has made it painfully clear that it is the Tsar, not Filov, who holds the real power in Bulgaria. He is faced with the choice of swallowing his pride and dignity to become the Tsar's loyal right hand man, or he could resign and hope his replacement has at least some competence."
bulgaria.9.a:0 "Resign, even politicians have their pride"
bulgaria.9.b:0 "Serving Bulgaria is more important"

bulgaria.10.t:0 "Former Tsar Ferdinand Dies"
bulgaria.10.d:0 "Ferdinand von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, former Tsar of all Bulgarians, is no more. Leading the country through two Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg, he was a symbol of Bulgarian greatness. Despite being regularly accused of corruption after his abdication, the old man remained popular amongst the people."
bulgaria.10.a:0 "He will be sorely missed"

bulgaria.11.t:0 "Syndicates"
bulgaria.11.d:0 "While the recent economic prosperity has increased the wage of the workers, the conditions in factories remains near unbearable. There are almost no regulations or laws which protect our worker's rights. This morning, factory workers went on strike in every major city and demanded that the ban on trade unions be removed!"
bulgaria.11.a:0 "Cave into their demands"
bulgaria.11.b:0 "Round up the demonstrators!"

bulgaria.12.t:0 "Peace with Bulgaria?"
bulgaria.12.d:0 "We have liberated Eastern Rumelia and decisively defeated Bulgaria! Because of the weak position of the Bulgarian state, they probably have no chance of taking it back and will likely accept a peace offer."
bulgaria.12.a:0 "Demand Eastern Rumelia"
bulgaria.12.b:0 "Demand Eastern Rumelia and Impose a Friendly Government"
bulgaria.12.c:0 "No, we want more!"

bulgaria.13.t:0 "Ottoman Empire offers Peace"
bulgaria.13.d:0 "After decisively defeating our armed forces and seizing Eastern Rumelia, the Ottoman Empire has offered peace. We must, however, cede Eastern Rumelia and relinquish all claims to it."
bulgaria.13.a:0 "Those damn Ottomans!"
bulgaria.13.b:0 "Never!"

bulgaria.14.t:0 "Ottoman Empire offers Peace"
bulgaria.14.d:0 "After decisively defeating our armed forces and seizing Eastern Rumelia, the Ottoman Empire has offered peace. We must, however, cede Eastern Rumelia, relinquish all claims to it and form a government friendly to the Ottomans."
bulgaria.14.a:0 "Those damn Ottomans!"
bulgaria.14.b:0 "Never!"

bulgaria.15.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts our terms"
bulgaria.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has accepted our peace terms, transferring Eastern Rumelia to our control and forming a new government friendly to the Ottoman Empire. This is a great day for our state!"
bulgaria.15.a:0 "We are victorious!"

bulgaria.16.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts our terms"
bulgaria.16.d:0 "Bulgaria has accepted our peace terms, transferring Eastern Rumelia to our control. This is a great day for our state!"
bulgaria.16.a:0 "We are victorious!"

bulgaria.17.t:0 "Our Rule in Southern Macedonia"
bulgaria.17.d:0 "Since we annexed it after the Weltkrieg, the Greek inhabitants of Southwest Macedonia have hoped to secede and reunite with the Kingdom of Greece. Recently however, they seem to have seen reason and we are receiving fewer reports of Greeks resisting our rule than usual. It appears we have finally cemented control over the entirety of Macedonia!"
bulgaria.17.a:0 "Unity makes strength!"

bulgaria.18.t:0 "A Choice in Albania"
bulgaria.18.d:0 "Public lobbying by the Tsar's war ministers and aggressive movements in Macedonia have assured that the Albanians know their place. Now is the time, if any, to make demands upon their government. We can chose to replace it with a friendlier cabinet, replace the cabinet and annex a stretch of land giving us a port on Adriatic or we can seize control of their entire nation."
bulgaria.18.a:0 "Puppet them, secure our west!"
bulgaria.18.b:0 "We need an Adriatic port!"
bulgaria.18.c:0 "The Balkans are all ours! Annex them!"

bulgaria.40.a:0 "The Democratic Alliance!"

### Army Focuses ###

BUL_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Investigate New Tactics"
BUL_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "The war of tomorrow is not likely to be the same war that the Weltkrieg was. Our military command should take this into account and consider developing new tactics."
BUL_equipment_effort_3:0 "Perfecting Our Arms"
BUL_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "Every misfire or slight fault with any of our equipment could lead to casualties. By paying attention to the minute, we can save lives and win any war."
BUL_armour_effort:0 "Native Panzers"
BUL_armour_effort_desc:0 "The Panzer is one of the major developments as a result of the Weltkrieg, but our own supply of them is lacking. We should develop a new model of Panzer that will revolutionise the"
BUL_special_forces:0 "Adapt Our Army"
BUL_special_forces_desc:0 "The Balkans are a manic terrain of soaring mountains and wild rivers. If we adapt certain elements of our Land Forces to deal with these extremes, then we shall have an obvious advantage."

### Air Focuses ###
BUL_rocket_effort:0 "Rocketry"
BUL_rocket_effort_desc:0 "Rockets and other similar developments hold greater promise than conventional artillery in the long-term. We should take all the steps we can to find new applications of this."

### Industry Focuses ###
BUL_industrial_effort:0 "Revitalise the Economy"
BUL_industrial_effort_desc:0 "The Bulgarian economy has been stagnant since the 20s - the Tsar has ordered that we must find a way to change our agrarian society into an industrial one!"
BUL_construction_effort:0 "State-Sponsored Industry"
BUL_construction_effort_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our nation will function effectively, the Bulgarian people must be provided for with goods and jobs. State-sponsored industrial expansion should fulfil both of these and reduce the effects of Black Monday."
BUL_production_effort:0 "Equip Our Men!"
BUL_production_effort_desc:0 "If we truly are the victors of the Weltkrieg, why is it our men aren't armed and equipped? We must build up our military industry to ensure we can assert our position."
BUL_construction_effort_2:0 "Industrialise the Tsardom"
BUL_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Despite our position in the Balkans, Bulgaria remains an agrarian society with little heavy industry. Tsar Boris III has ordered we change this, and so we shall. This should aid our recovery from Black Monday."
BUL_production_effort_2:0 "Military Investment"
BUL_production_effort_2_desc:0 "A man is no soldier without his rifle, no pilot without a plane and no Bulgarian without the will to fight for his country. We must ensure every man can defend his homeland and Tsar!"

BUL_production_effort_3:0 "Diversify Our Arms Industry"
BUL_production_effort_3_desc:0 "Arsenal AD stands nearly alone as our major arms manufacturer. If we are to ensure our men have the best of the best. By encouraging our native development of equipment this shall be achieved."

BUL_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "By changing slightly the path and timing of individual tracks and carriages we can ensure that every train is exactly on time, and our entire populace can travel where they like."
BUL_construction_effort_3:0 "Further Industrialisation"
BUL_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Despite increased numbers of factory-workers compared to farmers, we remain primarily agrarian. Further industrialisation is the only way to reform our economy and fully recover from Black Monday."

BUL_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Organised Research"
BUL_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "Many of our most important discoveries are as the result of independent researchers. By organising and directing the great minds of Bulgaria we should be able to put many more to work."
BUL_secret_weapons:0 "Special Research Division"
BUL_secret_weapons_desc:0 "There are many advances in science and engineering which should perhaps be kept hidden from the public and even most researchers. By isolating a special group of researchers to work on these projects we will be assuring privacy and success."

### Political Focuses ###
BUL_political_effort:0 "Political Direction"
BUL_political_effort_desc:0 "Bulgaria finds itself often torn between the interests of the Tsar and state. We should resolve this, in one way or another."

BUL_collectivist_ethos_kr:0 "United Under the Tsar"

BUL_rights_of_man_desc:0 "We should make every man in Bulgaria, whether Turk or Greek, equal under law."

BUL_serb_forts:0 "Fortify the Serbian Border"
BUL_serb_forts_desc:0 "The Serbs may have been bested once, but they are once more posturing and threatening the security of our peninsula. Fortifications along our border with them shall assure an impenetrable boundary."

BUL_call_to_arms_desc:0 "The Tsar has put out a call to the people of Bulgaria - they are once more commanded to rally to protect that which their predeccesors fought so hard to secure. We shall not lose what we have fought so hard to gain!"

### Recovering from Black Monday ###
BUL_native_industry_1:0 "Invest in Industry"
BUL_native_industry_1_desc:0 "We failed to make the most of our victory in the Third Balkan War, as Bulgaria plunged into economic stagnation in the 20s. Now is the time to change this and invest in our industry!"
BUL_military_industry_1:0 "Equip Our Men"
BUL_military_industry_1_desc:0 "The Victors of the Weltkrieg should not have a deficit of arms for our men, and the state of some of our equipment is pitiful. Our native arms industry is certainly capable - but not capable enough!"
BUL_bm_1:0 "Black Monday Weakens"
BUL_bm_1_desc:0 "The crash of the German economy had countless knock-on effects on our own. But through Bulgarian spirit and the strength of our government, the effects are beginning to fade."
BUL_native_industry_2:0 "Examine the Economy"
BUL_native_industry_2_desc:0 "Factories remain closed across the entirety of Bulgaria and many of our people continue to lack jobs. A comprehensive examination of our civilian industry should allow us to re-open these factories and put our people to work once more."

BUL_military_industry_2_desc:0 "A man is no soldier without his rifle, no pilot without a plane and no Bulgarian without the will to fight for his country. We must ensure every man can defend his homeland and Tsar, and that means a strong arms industry!"
BUL_bm_2:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
BUL_bm_2_desc:0 "It would be foolish to say that our fine nation is repaired - many on the streets of Sofia still hunger. But it is true to say that we are recovering. Bulgaria will rise once more!"
BUL_native_industry_3:0 "Targeted Funding"
BUL_native_industry_3_desc:0 "Over expenditure and careless funding can lead to more problems than it fixes in times of downturn. The Bulgarian economy will benefit the most from targeted and limited funding, bringing those industries to the fore that will ensure we dig ourselves out of this hole."
BUL_military_industry_3:0 "Diversify our Arms Industry"
BUL_military_industry_3_desc:0 "Arsenal AD stands nearly alone as our major arms manufacturer. If we are to ensure our men have the best of the best, there must be competition. State funding towards other smaller manufacturers will ensure this."

BUL_research_slot_1_desc:0 "The great minds of Bulgaria lack but one thing to make amazing developments - funding. The importance of military developments cannot be underestimated, so we should allocate funding towards the Bulgarian intelligista."
BUL_research_slot_2:0 "Balkan Intelligista"
BUL_research_slot_2_desc:0 "All the people of the Balkans, not just the Bulgarians, have ideas worth investing in. We should improve our attempts to include and integrate the scientists and engineers who, although not Bulgarian, have worthy minds."
BUL_motorised_army:0 "Explore Motorisation"
BUL_motorised_army_desc:0 "While the terrain of the Balkans may not be ideal for a wholly motorised army, the mobility this would provide would still be immensely useful."

BUL_secure_dobrogea_desc:0 "Dobrogea is a Bulgarian possession - it is only through the machinations of foreign powers such as the Russians that we have failed to take it until recently. Now is the time to secure it, and make full use of it's native population and industry."

BUL_dominate_albania:0 "Dominate Albania"
BUL_dominate_albania:0 "The Albanian nation is weak, especially now without the support of the Ottoman Empire. If there is any time to assert our dominance over it, that time is now, so we can secure an Adriatic port."

BUL_large_navy:0 "Naval Power Projection"

BUL_submarine_effort:0 "Bulgarian Submarines"
