submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."
destroyer_1:0 "Destroyer I"
destroyer_2:0 "Destroyer II"
destroyer_3:0 "Destroyer III"
destroyer_4:0 "Destroyer IV"
destroyer_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
destroyer_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
destroyer_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
destroyer_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."

light_cruiser_2:0 "Light Cruiser II"
light_cruiser_3:0 "Light Cruiser III"
light_cruiser_4:0 "Light Cruiser IV"
light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Manoeuvrable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Post-war treaties put restrictions on cruisers, but well-armed light vessels can be developed while remaining within these limits."
light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armoured cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks."

heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Heavy Cruiser II"
heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Heavy Cruiser III"
heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Heavy Cruiser IV"
heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armour light, the weapons load can be increased."
heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armour is still limited."
heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armour can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."

carrier_6:0 "Carrier VI"
carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilising these new doctrines."
carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy, while respecting the post-war naval treaties."
carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialised systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."

submarine_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg U-boat"
submarine_pre_desc:0 "The first U-boats opened a new horizon for naval warfare. These new vessels can break through enemy waters without being detected and wreak havoc on the convoy routes."
destroyer_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Destroyer"
destroyer_pre_desc:0 "Before the Weltkrieg these destroyers were used to protect capital ships from torpedo boats. Some of them were equipped with torpedoes themselves."
light_cruiser_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Light Cruiser"
light_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "Protected Cruisers were used to protect trade routes and scout enemy waters. Some of them were equipped with torpedoes effectively making them to torpedo cruisers."
heavy_cruiser_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Heavy Cruiser"
heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The armoured cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered."
battle_cruiser_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Battle Cruiser"
battle_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships."
battleship_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Battleship"
battleship_pre_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armoured vessels ever built."
carrier_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Carrier"
carrier_pre_desc:0 "These Escort Carriers and Seaplane Tenders were the predecessors of today's aircraft carriers."

### Union of Britain ###
### Submarines ####
ENG_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding program of 1938-1943 as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of the first Weltkrieg and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They were used even after the modernization project of the 1930s and 1940s."
ENG_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
ENG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflicts throughout this time period."
ENG_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
ENG_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
ENG_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."

### Destroyers ####
ENG_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admiralty and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First Weltkrieg, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WK1 and became the backbone of the Republican Navy's destroyer flotillas after the 1925 revolution. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
ENG_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
ENG_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
ENG_destroyer_4:0 "Sark Class"
ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sark-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."

### Light Cruisers ###
ENG_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First Weltkrieg for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
ENG_light_cruiser_2:0 "York Class"
ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The York-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the German Emden-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
ENG_light_cruiser_3:0 "Birmingham Class"
ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Birmingham-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced."
ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "London Class"
ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Birmingham class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Birmingham class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."

### Heavy Cruisers ###
ENG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Essex Class"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Essex-class heavy cruisers were the first class of Heavy Cruisers built by the Union of Britain followed the revolution in 1925. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Cumberland Class"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cumberland-class heavy cruisers were an attempt by the Republican Navy to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Somerset Class"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Somerset Class was designed during the 1940s to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships."

### Battle Cruisers ###
ENG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Revolution Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Revolution-Class, also called the Renown Class, were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WKI. Following the revolution, the new Republican Navy managed to restart their construction as battle cruisers. These ships were the quintessential battle cruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armour and a shorter operational range."
ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Invincible Class"
ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Invincible were a class of battle cruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the Blake-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Republican Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

### Battleships ###
ENG_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
ENG_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armoured, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
ENG_battleship_2:0 "Blake Class"
ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Blake-class battleships were the first Battleships that the Republican Navy designed. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. They were designed to replace the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships that were used by the old regime."
ENG_battleship_3:0 "Lilburne Class"
ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lilburne-class battleships were the follow-up class to the Blake battleships, incorporating many of their features. The vessels are similar to the Black-Class ships, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armour and more powerful engines."
ENG_battleship_4:0 "Fairfax Class"
ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Fairfax-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Republican Navy. Ordered under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."

### Super Heavy Battleships ###
ENG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Winstanley Class"
ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Winstanley is a class of heavy battleships of the Republican Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German navy. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the seas around the Union of Britain."
ENG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Sexby Class"
ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Sexby-Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."

### Carriers ###
ENG_carrier_1:0 "Owen Class"
ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battle cruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Republican Navy. Their conversions came about following the revolution in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Republican Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
ENG_carrier_2:0 "Besant Class"
ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Besant aircraft carrier was the first proper aircraft carrier to be built by the Republican Navy. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the forces of the Republican Navy."
ENG_carrier_3:0 "Wallas Class"
ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Wallas class was designed to be an armoured aircraft carrier. Due to the armouring on the ship it limited the size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
ENG_carrier_4:0 "Morris Class"
ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Morris-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Wallas class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Wallas class."

### Japan KR ###

JAP_submarine_pre:1 "Kaichu Class"
JAP_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The Kaichu class U-boats were built after WWI and based on the earlier U-boats. These medium-sized U-boats were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type U-boats were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
JAP_submarine_1:1 "Kaidai III Class"
JAP_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Kaidai type U-boat (Kaidai-gata sensuikan) was a type of 1st class U-boat operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) before and during World War II. The type name, was shortened to Kaigun-shiki Ōgata Sensuikan. The nine Kaidai IIIs were based on earlier designs, but featured a strengthened hull. The "IIIb" types were 40 cm longer and had a different bow design. All nine boats were constructed between 1927 and 1930."
JAP_destroyer_pre:1 "Momi Class"
JAP_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Momi class was a development of the Enoki second-class destroyers, relying on the same basic hull. They were quite small, comparable to Royal Navy corvettes. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers captured during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."
JAP_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Suma Class"
JAP_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "While more lightly armed and armoured than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations. Both participated in combat during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I."
JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Izumo Class"
JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Izumo-class cruisers were a pair of armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the 'Six-Six Fleet' expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I."
JAP_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Tsukuba Class"
JAP_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Tsukuba-class cruisers were a pair of large armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN."
JAP_battleship_pre:1 "Fuso Class"
JAP_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernised in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armoured and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centreline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
JAP_battleship_1:1 "Nagato Class"
JAP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Nagato-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Nagato, the lead ship of the class, frequently served as a flagship. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernised in 1933–36 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style."
JAP_carrier_pre:1 "Hosho Class"
JAP_carrier_pre_desc:1 "Hōshō, literally 'phoenix in flight' was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews."
JAP_carrier_1_desc:1 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was one of Japan's first fleet carriers. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armoured carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

JAP_destroyer_3:0 "Akizuki Class"
JAP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Akizuki class destroyers were well-armed with both surface guns and torpedoes, adequate AA armament, as well as much needed extra depth charges. Out of the 39 planned only 12 were completed before the series was cancelled."
JAP_destroyer_4:0 "Shimakaze Class"
JAP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Shimakaze class was the fastest destroyer in the world at the time of its completion. It was a prototype destroyer to test out new high-temperature, high-pressure turbines. It was extremely fast and heavily armed with torpedoes, but this meant a smaller radius of operations."
JAP_light_cruiser_1:0 "Tenryu Class"
JAP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Tenryu class ships displaced around 4,400 tons and were lightly armed compared to the similar vessels of other navies, but good speed and adequate torpedo armament made up for these shortcomings. They were designed to act as flagships for destroyer flotillas, and thus considered an intermediate class between the light cruiser and the destroyer."

JAP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The heavy Mogami class was an up-gunned and reclassified light cruiser class. This made them fast, heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers. Their long range came at the cost of, thinner armour protection."
JAP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Tone Class"
JAP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tone class heavy cruisers were originally designed as light cruisers, but re-envisioned with heavier armaments. They were unique in that all armaments were positioned forward, while the aft part of the ship was used to carry and service float-planes that scouted for enemy forces."
JAP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Ibuki Class"
JAP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ibuki-class heavy cruisers were the last cruisers to be built by Japan before the end of the war. They were improved versions of the Mogami class heavy cruisers, featuring the same layout and armament but with more modern AA weaponry and engines."
JAP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Amagi Class"
JAP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Amagi battlecruisers were a series of planned battlecruisers as part of the Japanese Navy's ambitious plan to have eight battleships and eight battlecruisers. Following the Washington Naval Treaty, the Amagi ships were scrapped, and one converted to a carrier."
JAP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Design B-65"
JAP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Design B-65 battlecruisers were fast, moderately armoured vessels with good AA weaponry and modern armaments. Designed to fight the new heavy cruisers of the US Navy and to protect the fleet carriers of the IJN, the ships would have been a force to be reckoned with if finished."
#JAP_battleship_1:0 "Fuso Class"
#JAP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernised in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armoured and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
#JAP_battleship_1b: "Ise Class" (refit version)
#JAP_battleship_1c: "Nagato Class" (refit version)
JAP_battleship_2:0 "Kongo Class"
JAP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Kongo battleships were built for the IJN just before World War I as battlecruisers, but were heavily modernised in the late 1930s and reclassified as first rate fast battleships. Their armour, guns and engines were all drastically upgraded and the Kongos emerged as the fastest Japanese battleships of the war."
JAP_battleship_3:0 "Tajima Class"
JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilised the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armour and AA provided the defence for these ships."
JAP_battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class"
JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilised new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
JAP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class"
JAP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
JAP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Yamato Class"
JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armour thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
JAP_carrier_1:0 "Kaga Class"
#JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armoured carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
#JAP_carrier_1b: "Akagi Class" (refit Kaga class)
JAP_carrier_2:0 "Soryu Class"
JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armoured. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
#JAP_carrier_2b: "Hiryu Class"
JAP_carrier_3:0 "Shokaku Class"
JAP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Shokaku class aircraft carriers were designed for high speed, long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity, which made them excellent carriers. Due to the improved construction methods, they displaced 33.000tons full load, and could survive more damage than most contemporary carriers."
#JAP_carrier_3b: "Hiyo Class"
JAP_carrier_4:0 "Taiho Class"
JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armoured carriers, with an armoured flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defence but also force projection over enemy forces."

RUS_destroyer_pre:0 "Novik Class"
RUS_destroyer_1:0 "Orfey Class"
RUS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Novik class. They feature a decent surface and AA armament for their size, a somewhat short range, but a good speed and a heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes are further improved versions of this class with an increased main armament and hull size."
RUS_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class"
RUS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny-class destroyers are an important part of the 1934-1937 shipbuilding program. The class itself is heavily influenced by the latest foreign projects and considered a successful design. Their weight is in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they are well-armed and have a decent AA and torpedo armament. Due to their powerful engines, they are fast but somewhat short-ranged vessels."
RUS_destroyer_3:0 "Soobrazitelnyi Class"
RUS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines are redesigned and they have a stronger AA armament. They weigh between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range are similar to the Gnevny class."
RUS_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
RUS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class is a further improvement on the Soobrazitelnyi class. The increase in size and weight (2,500-3,100 tons) results in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships are built as a modular design that results in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament is the same as that of the previous Soobrazitelnyi class, but the main guns are housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."

RUS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Svetlana Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Svetlana-class cruiser, had her construction started before Second Patriotic war but the war defeat and the following revolution and civil war delayed the completion of the entire class. In the late 1920's, she was finally commissioned for the Russian Navy along with her half-sister Yaroslav. Those vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Russian Navy. They are heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers for ships of their time."
RUS_light_cruiser_2:0 "Ruslan Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Ruslan-class light cruisers are a series of vessels, which are somewhat of a mix of older and more recent technologies. Using hulls of the Svetlana and Yaroslav classes as a base for the new project, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer calibre guns and a decent AA armament they are suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities with the Oleg class cruisers."
RUS_light_cruiser_3:0 "Kazarsky Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Kazarsky-class cruisers are based on the Oleg class cruisers and are included in the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. As the first true modern light cruiser of the Russian navy, they carry a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with a decent torpedo armament. Overall, those are good ships with a thick armour, high speed, a good operational range, and a weight between 10,500 and 14,000 tons."
RUS_light_cruiser_4:0 "Slava Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Slava-class cruisers are the most numerous cruisers of the Russian Navy and are improved versions of the preceding Kazarsky class. Compared to the Kazarsky's, they have the same armament, machinery and armour, but have an increased fuel capacity allowing for a bigger range, improved U-boat protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and a slightly better manoeuvrability. They are designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts."

RUS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Yaroslav Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Yaroslav-class cruisers are the half-sisters of the Svetlana-class and the first heavy cruisers of Russian Navy. Yaroslav was completed with a modified design that included larger-calibre 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because it is a rebuilt light cruiser, it's armour is thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Oleg Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Oleg-class cruisers are the Russian Navy's first modern heavy cruisers. The design is based on the cancelled Interbellum Russian cruiser projects and is built as part of the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. The ships are displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They are armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provide good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armour belt is thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Alexandr Nevskyi Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Alexandr Nevskyi-class heavy cruisers were designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's to counter similar vessels in neighbouring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They are equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defence, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks are scouting for enemy forces and convoy hunting."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Dmytryi Donskoi Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Dmytryi Donskoy-class heavy cruisers are the development of the previous Alexandr Nevskyi class. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged in 1945. The vessels feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement is at least 26,500 tons."

RUS_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Ismail Class"
RUS_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Ismail-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorised in 1914, just before Second Patriotic war. Their design was based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of Second Patriotic war and the Russian Revolution delayed these ships from being finished in time."
RUS_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Poltava Class"
RUS_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Poltava-class battlecruisers are authorised in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized modern heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on the latest foreign battlecruiser vessels had arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons."

RUS_battleship_1:0 "Sevastopol Class"
RUS_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sevastopol-class battleships were Second Patriotic war-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only four ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernised and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They have modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
RUS_battleship_2:0 "Vladivostok Class"
RUS_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Vladivostok-class battleships are designed in the late 1930's to be part of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships displace around 41,000 tons, are armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets, and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armour provide a strong defence against air and surface targets. The project elements are used in the Vladimir Monomakh-class battleships."
RUS_battleship_3:0 "Peterburg Class"
RUS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Peterburg-class battleship is a design to match and counter any existing foreign battleships of any potential opponent country. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets are designed to provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armour, and large engines can ensure its survival in battle."
RUS_battleship_4:0 "Moskva Class"
RUS_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Moskva-class battleships are intended to provide the Russian Navy with its primary firepower in the new era of naval warfare. They are fast, well-armed, and well-armoured vessels, which have taken all the best from previous Russian battleship projects. There are projects to equip battleships of that class with R-2 series ballistic missiles."

RUS_SH_battleship_1:0 "Vladimir Monomakh"
RUS_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Vladimir Monomakh-class is authorised in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program for the rebuilding Russian Navy. The ships are planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also have strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armour."
RUS_SH_battleship_2:0 "Ivan Groznyi"
RUS_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Ivan Groznyi-class battleships are a modified and improved version of the previous Vladimir Monomakh-class. Compared to their predecessors, they carry four triple turrets of the same 406mm calibre cannons, thickened belt armour, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament to counter the increased threat from the carrier-based planes."

RUS_carrier_1:0 "Borodino Class"
RUS_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class aircraft carrier is the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Ismail-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship has a thick armour belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group provides her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out until late 1930-s due to costs and the state of the Russian shipbuilding industry after the revolution and civil war."
RUS_carrier_2:0 "Azov Class"
RUS_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Azov-class aircraft carrier is a design to provide the Russian Navy air projection over its fleets. They are similar in size to the contemporary foreign classes but carry additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armour results in a slightly reduced air group compared to foreign counterparts."
RUS_carrier_3:0 "Narva Class"
RUS_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Narva-class carriers are designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's. They are planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets ordered in the plan of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships are planned to displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armour, and an adequate air group."
RUS_carrier_4:0 "Kronstadt Class"
RUS_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Kronstadt-class aircraft carriers are the improved versions of the previous Narva-class ships. Design studies finished in the 1945 resulting in a larger ship with thinner armour. The extra space is used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

RUS_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
RUS_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during Second Patriotic war, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
RUS_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shuka"
RUS_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class are the second-most numerous submarines of the Russian Navy. Their large number come from their deployment to the four fleets of the Russian state: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They are medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV Delfin"
RUS_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines are large cruising submarines of the Russian Navy with extended range. They are essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines feature heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They have a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_4:0 "Series XXV Kosatka"
RUS_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Series XXV submarines, are the development of the previous cruising submarines projects, created for Russian Navy. Their design is heavily influenced by the German Type XXI submarines, and they are meant to replace the older Series XIV boats. They are large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range."

### Ottoman Empire ###

FLEET_NAME_OTT:0 "$NUMBER$. Donanma Firkasi"

OTT_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Yavuz Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Yavuz-class is a licenced copy of the German Moltke-class battlecruisers. During the Weltkrieg, the Moltke-class SMS Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Navy and renamed the Yavuz Sultan Selim, effectively founding the class. After the war, the Ottomans purchased a licence to produce additional Yavuz-class battlecruisers.

OTT_battle_cruiser_1:1 "Oruç Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Oruç Reis class is a fairly typical battlecruiser of the post-Weltkrieg era. It is heavily based on the preceding Yavuz-class, with the twin wing turrets replaced by a second super-firing front turret, allowing the same weight of fire in a broadside volley while saving significant weight."

OTT_battle_cruiser_2:1 "Piri Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Piri Reis class was designed with economy in mind, given the Empire's increasing economic difficulties. Wherever possible, non-critical elements were to be made from cheaper materials, and many crew conveniences were reduced or deleted. Nonetheless, the combat capabilities of the Piri Reis class were not skimped on, and it is easily in the same league as modern battlecruisers in foreign navies."

OTT_battle_cruiser_3:1 "Aydın Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the sacrifices made in the design of the Piri Reis class led to widespread discontent and borderline mutiny among naval personnel, and the more frequent maintenance and replacement of substandard parts negated the initial cost savings, the Aydın Reis class abandoned the idea of being as cheap as possible. It is an ambitious design that incorporates many examples of modern, cutting-edge technology, so despite having broadside volley firepower no better than the Piri Reis or Oruç Reis class designs, heavy-duty autoloaders grant it a reload rate almost on par with that of a heavy cruiser, granting it significant overall firepower."

OTT_battle_cruiser_4:1 "Hızır Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Hızır Reis class is in some ways more conservative than the preceding Aydın Reis. It abandons the 28cm guns used by all Turkish battlecruisers up to this point, even with the powerful, but temperamental autoloaders used on the Aydın Reis, in favour of significantly larger, battleship-grade models. Five double 40.6cm gun turrets do give it less overall firepower than modern battleships, and a lower rate of fire than with the smaller 28cm guns, but its high speed and manoeuvrability, and respectable belt armour, compensate for these shortcomings, making the Yildirim a fast, deadly warship."

OTT_battleship_pre:1 "Reşadiye Class"
OTT_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Reşadiye-class battleships were designed during the Weltkrieg, and have undergone significant modernisation since. They are heavily armed and armoured, with six twin 30cm centreline turrets giving a heavy broadside, and 16 150mm casemate guns providing close protection, but this design limited the available room for extra AA weaponry that could be added during refits."

OTT_battleship_1:1 "Kanuni Class"
OTT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Kanuni-class battleships were a pair of ships designed during the later stages of the Weltkrieg. After the Treaty of Versailles, their construction was put on hold, and after the Peace with Honour both partially completed vessels were scrapped. Their design was quite modern for the era, with four twin 40.6cm turrets providing a heavy broadside volley, 12 150mm casemate-mounted secondary guns, and another 10 77mm open gun mounts, which could also be used against aircraft."

OTT_battleship_2:1 "Yıldırım Class"
OTT_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Yıldırım-class is an iteration on the Kanuni-class design, longer and wider to accommodate a fifth double turret, and with a reduced secondary casemate armament in favour of dual-purpose guns and small-calibre anti-aircraft turrets."

OTT_battleship_3:1 "Abdülhamid Class"
OTT_battleship_3_desc:1 "The Abdülhamid-class is a very modern battleship design, with three triple centreline turrets allowing for similar firepower to the Yıldırım-class in a shorter, more compact ship. Extra attention was given to the armour scheme and the torpedo protection, offering this ship excellent survivability. The casemate secondaries have been eliminated entirely, replaced by a larger number of 88mm dual-purpose guns."

OTT_battleship_4:1 "Abdülmecid Class"
OTT_battleship_4_desc:1 "After the shortcomings of the Abdülhamid-class became clear, the Abdülmecid-class was designed as a significantly longer ship, granting room to bring back the 150mm secondary guns, this time mounted in twin turrets, four to a side. The 88mm guns have received magazine feeding systems, and with eight single mountings and six triple turrets, all centrally guided by radar fire control, they can project a withering amount of defensive anti-air and anti-destroyer firepower."

OTT_SH_battleship_1:1 "Hümayun Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Designed to take and deal heavy punishment, the Hümayun-class is an extravagantly expensive battleship design, boasting the thickest hull armour in the Ottoman Navy, and a deadly broadside from its four triple 40.6cm turrets. Despite its heavy close-range secondary armament, consisting of casemate-mounted guns, dual-purpose 88mm guns, and a blistering array of autocannons, the Hümayun still needs to be properly escorted, or aerial and U-boat threats will send her to the bottom."

OTT_SH_battleship_2:1 "Hanedan Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Hanedan-class is even larger and more powerful than the preceding Hümayun-class. She is a long, broad ship, barely able to pass through the Bosphorus, with a main armament of three triple 46cm gun turrets, two double 21cm secondary gun turrets, fourteen double 150mm dual-purpose turrets, and numerous magazine-fed single-mount and triple-turret 88mm guns, with one suite of radar fire control for the 46cm and 21cm guns and two additional ones for the smaller defensive armament. Despite all of this, her modern turbine engines make her faster than the Hümayun. As such, the papers have dubbed her the Sultan of the Seas."

OTT_carrier_pre:1 "Ertuğrul Class"
OTT_carrier_pre_desc:1 "After the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Navy recovered the wreckage of the British seaplane carrier HMS Ben-my-Chree, repaired and refitted her, and returned her to active duty in 1925. Her new name comes from the artillery officer, Mustafa Ertuğrul Pasha, whose battery sank her off at Kızılhisar. The recovered seaplanes, though too heavily damaged to be put back into service, and the aircraft handling mechanisms were studied particularly intently, both by the Ottoman Navy and the Air Force, providing a solid foundation on which to base further development of naval aviation."

OTT_carrier_1:1 "Peyk-i Şeref Class"
OTT_carrier_1_desc:1 "Featuring a short runway on a converted hull, this aircraft carrier design is the Ottoman Navy's effort to catch up with competing naval aviation programs. It is armed with a 3cm Kuşçu AA gun, as well as several machine gun mounts, in order to defend itself against aerial threats."

OTT_carrier_2:1 "Âsâr-ı Tevfik Class"
OTT_carrier_2_desc:1 "The Âsâr-ı Tevfik class is a much larger design than its predecessors, with larger hangar capacity and a longer runway. While it is still a conversion design, based on naval transport ships, its capabilities are broadly comparable to the older purpose-built carriers of other navies. It was initially designed with a large array of 3cm Kuşçu guns, but these outdated weapons have been scrapped in favour of several modern 88mm dual-purpose guns, capable of firing on nearby naval targets as well, and a number of more modern autocannon mounts. The engines of the transport ships converted to Âsâr-ı Tevfiks are also replaced with modern steam turbine designs."

OTT_carrier_3:1 "Muin-i Zafer Class"
OTT_carrier_3_desc:1 "The Muin-i Zafer class was originally planned as a seaplane carrier design; however, it quickly became clear that this type of ship is no longer suitable for main-line use in a modern navy. Instead, the Âsâr-ı Tevfik class conversion design was used as a base for a new purpose-built aircraft carrier, longer and more well-armoured than its predecessor, armed with a respectable number of 88mm Tophane guns, in addition to two experimental high-elevation dual-purpose 150mm gun mounts."

OTT_carrier_4:1 "Berk-i Satvet Class"
OTT_carrier_4_desc:1 "The Berk-i Satvet class is the most advanced carrier ever designed for the Ottoman Navy. She is slightly longer than the Muin-i Zafer class, several metres taller, and almost twice as wide, giving her a significantly increased hangar capacity as well as a powerful armament suite of three twin dual-purpose 150mm gun turrets and six triple 88mm turrets. She also has provisions for installing the experimental Kulak radar array, which, when development is finished, will greatly increase her effective spotting range and gun direction."

OTT_submarine_pre:1 "Çanakkale Class"
OTT_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The first Çanakkale-class U-boats were built late during the Weltkrieg. These U-boats have very good torpedo armament for their time, but their slightly underpowered engines and thin hull make them vulnerable."

OTT_submarine_1:1 "Tahtelbahir Class"
OTT_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Tahtelbahir-class U-boats are improved versions of the Çanakkale-class. This design was developed in the 1920s, fixing the problems that plagued its predecessor, while improving its attack capabilities with heavier, more modern torpedoes."

OTT_submarine_2:1 "Denizkızı Class"
OTT_submarine_2_desc:1 "The Denizkızı class breaks with the tradition of its predecessors by not focusing primarily on armament. It is a long, sleek design, with four frontal and two rear 533mm torpedo tubes, and a supercharged diesel engine that makes it one of the fastest U-boat designs in the world at the time of its design."

OTT_submarine_3:1 "Ay Class"
OTT_submarine_3_desc:1 "Largely an iteration on the preceding Denizkızı-class, the Ay-class is essentially a fatter version of the former, with thicker hull plating ensuring greater survivability, an extra two bow torpedo tubes, and a deck-mounted 88mm gun. Despite all this increased mass, the larger internal space allows for a larger engine too, which means it isn't any slower than its predecessor."

OTT_submarine_4:1 "Bozkurt Class"
OTT_submarine_4_desc:1 "The Bozkurt-class is a fairly unremarkable design overall. A further iteration of existing U-boat designs, improvements over the preceding Ay-class are mostly incremental. The addition of a more modern hydro-acoustic sonar system built under licence improves its ability to hunt other U-boats, at the cost of giving away its location to enemy U-boats and destroyers when in use. Besides this, the biggest change is the enlargement of the torpedo tubes from 533mm to 610mm."

OTT_destroyer_pre:1 "Taşoz Class"
OTT_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Taşoz-class was a development of the Durandal-class destroyers, relying on the same small basic hull. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers used during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."

OTT_destroyer_1:1 "İzmir Class"
OTT_destroyer_1_desc:1 "The İzmir-class is a fairly standard late Weltkrieg destroyer design, with a light armament of three 77mm guns, a twin 533mm torpedo tube mounted in the well deck, and two more mounted further back, on the ship's centreline. Powerful turbine engines give it a high top speed. However, as with all destroyers, its armour protection is practically nonexistent."

OTT_destroyer_2:1 "Kostantiniyye Class"
OTT_destroyer_2_desc:1 "The Kostantiniyye-class is designed as more of a gunboat, with two triple centreline 533mm torpedo tubes but four twin 77mm guns on rapid motorised mounts. As destroyers go, it is a fairly compact design, intended for fast manoeuvres at high speed."

OTT_destroyer_3:1 "Bursa Class"
OTT_destroyer_3_desc:1 "While the Kostantiniyye-class may have been a strong design for hunting other destroyers, its smaller torpedo armament compared to its contemporaries limited its overall usefulness. As such, the Bursa-class has cut back on the number of guns, being only three single 88mm guns this time, but three triple centreline 610mm torpedo tubes firing extended-range torpedoes, and a lengthened rear deck with additional depth charge launchers compared to the Kostantiniyye-class."

OTT_destroyer_4:1 "Tekirdağ Class"
OTT_destroyer_4_desc:1 "The Tekirdağ-class is a modern design, featuring fully enclosed motorised high-elevation dual-purpose turrets for its three 88mm guns, and five triple torpedo launchers. With one mounted behind the wheelhouse, and two on each side of the ship's midsection, it cannot get all its torpedoes in the water against a single target without heavy manoeuvring, but it can carry more of them than other destroyers of similar size with centreline launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Midilli Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "Originally Magdeburg-class light cruisers transferred from the German Hochseeflotte, starting with SMS Breslau, renamed Midilli. These ships' lighter armament than other contemporary cruisers, consisting of 12 105mm guns, was replaced with a more standard arrangement of 8 150mm guns in Ottoman service. Their small size and high speed made them useful as scout cruisers and blockade runners."

OTT_light_cruiser_1:1 "Kıbrıs Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Kıbrıs-class scout cruisers are late Weltkrieg designs intended for tracking Entente fleet movements in the Mediterranean and engaging targets of opportunity. To that end, they carried a fairly light 150mm gun armament, relying more on six twin side-mounted torpedo tubes for engaging any serious threats that they could not simply run away from. Their high-powered engines are maintenance-intensive, but they grant these ships a high cruise speed, and they can be pushed to their limits for brief periods if a rapid escape is called for."

OTT_light_cruiser_2:1 "Rodos Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "As land-based naval bombers and carrier-based naval aviation has become more and more common after the Weltkrieg, the Rodos-class was designed with an anti-air escort role in mind. Their primary armament is limited to six 150mm gun mounts, but they also carry ten high-elevation dual-purpose 77mm gun mounts and numerous autocannons and machine guns. Should they need to engage heavier surface ships, they can also still use their two triple torpedo launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_3:1 "Girit Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the lessons of the Rodos-class, the Girit-class carries significantly more surface-to-surface firepower. However, as the main role of these ships is still anti-air, it only carries three twin 150mm turrets, with the remaining eight guns in somewhat outdated casemate mounts on the side of the ship. This leaves room on the deck and superstructure for four fully-enclosed motorised twin 88mm dual-purpose turrets and six more single 88mm gun mounts. Provisions are also made for mounting an air detection radar."

OTT_light_cruiser_4:1 "Marmara Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_4_desc:1 "With naval aviation becoming more prominent, and battleship anti-air suites more powerful, the role of the light cruiser as primarily an anti-air escort ship appears to be over. The Marmara-class still carries potent anti-air firepower, helped by the fact that its main 150mm armament is now also mounted in dual-purpose turrets, but its torpedo armament has also been significantly expanded in order to expand its role as an agile anti-surface combatant. Two quadruple torpedo launchers on each side complement five twin 150mm gun turrets and two triple 88mm turrets, with the usual autocannons rounding out its armament."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Turgut Reis Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Turgut Reis class is a heavy armoured cruiser design intended to accompany battleships in the battle line and engage smaller surface combatants like cruisers and destroyers while the capital ships slug it out. It carries a mixed primary armament of four 21cm guns, six 150mm guns, and eight 77mm guns. Its low speed is compensated for by its thick armour protection, allowing it to stand up to several battleship-calibre hits."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_1:1 "Mesudiye Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Mesudiye-class is a modern design for its time, carrying its eight main 21cm guns in four fully-enclosed superfiring turrets. However, despite carrying fewer smaller guns, this increased weight allocated to the armament means it does not boast armour as heavy as the Turgut Reis class."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_2:1 "Muavenet Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Muavenet-class was designed to bring heavy firepower to bear at a budget. It is small for a heavy cruiser, and carries lighter armament than most others, in the form of three double 21cm turrets and four enclosed 150mm turrets, but this lowers its displacement enough compared to other contemporary heavy cruisers that its speed, manoeuvrability, and armour are all above average, while the cost stays relatively low."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_3:1 "Kırım Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:1 "More modern manufacturing techniques and assembly line construction allow the Kırım-class heavy cruisers to remain relatively low-cost, like their predecessor design, while offering increased combat capabilities. Five double 21cm turrets give it a very heavy broadside, but the awkward gun arrangement, with one forward turret, two superfiring rear turrets, and the remaining two turrets mounted amidships between the superstructure, means it has to fully expose its vulnerable side armour in order to get all guns firing at the same target."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_4:1 "Giray Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Giray-class does away with its predecessor's undesirable turret arrangement and instead uses three triple 21cm turrets to provide similar weight of fire in a more convenient manner. The addition of two of the new twin 150mm dual-purpose turrets significantly improve its anti-air firepower."

### Ireland ###

IRE_submarine_1:0 "Holland Class"
IRE_submarine_1_desc:0 "Named after the Irish engineer who developed the first U-boat formally commissioned by the U.S Navy, the Holland Class is an early Irish attempt into the secretive world of U-boat warfare. It had numerous issues and saw very little actual service, but proved a useful platform to build on for future members of the U-boat family."
IRE_submarine_2:0 "Wolfhound Class"
IRE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The feared Wolfhound Class of U-boat proved to be a terror of the Irish sea during WK2. Commissioned explicitly on the orders of Michael Collins, who feared that a war with the Union of Britain might destroy his nation, the Wolfhound was a cheap yet powerful U-boat that carried an expansive arsenal of 8 torpedo tubes and made full use of the experimental Marfóir torpedo."
IRE_submarine_3:0 "Banshee Class"
IRE_submarine_3_desc:0 "A latter expansion upon the design of the Wolfhound, the Banshee was a larger U-boat that could operate at deeper levels and stay undetected. It was so named in honour of the female Irish fighter pilots who kept the skies above the Irish Sea safe whilst the Banshee did the same beneath the surface. Its scream may have often been silent, but it was no less deadly."
IRE_submarine_4:0 "Kelpie Class"
IRE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The most advanced U-boat of its kind during WK2, the Kelpie was a joint venture between German and Irish engineers, and had a much longer range than the previous designs, which were typically deployed in the Irish Sea and the Atlantic. The Kelpie could reach far further shores, and could conduct long-range trade warfare that posed a major threat to the Entente powers in particular."

IRE_SH_battleship_2:0 "Bánánach Class"
IRE_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "Bigger, badder, and even more expensive to produce than the Balor, the Bánánach boasts a main armament of 12 x 18"/50 calibre guns to offer almost unmatched firepower relative to other Irish designs."

### Sweden ###

SWE_submarine_1:0 "Hajen Class"
SWE_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Hajen, Bävern, Valen classes were a series of small to medium-sized U-boats built for the Swedish Navy during the 1920s. The Hajen class, commissioned in 1920, had U-boats that displaced nearly 400 tons and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes. They had a diving depth of only 30m."

SWE_submarine_2:0 "Sjölejonet Class"
SWE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Sjölejonet-class consisted of nine U-boats built between 1936 and 1942. They were medium-sized subs, displacing 580 tons, and their design was heavily influenced by the Dutch O-class U-boats. They were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes and had a diving depth of 60m."

SWE_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
SWE_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Swedish U-class U-boats were a class of nine subs commissioned between 1942 and 1944. They were fairly small and relatively slow, displacing only 370 tons. They were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_submarine_4:0 "Neptun Class"
SWE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Neptun class consisted of three medium-sized U-boats that were all commissioned in 1943. They were used primarily for mine laying duties. They displaced 550 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_destroyer_1:0 "Ehrensköld Class"
SWE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The two destroyers of the Ehrensköld class were completed in 1927, as the first modern destroyers for Sweden following World War I. They displaced just over 970 tons and were armed with three 120mm/44 K/45 guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a short range but good speed."

SWE_destroyer_2:0 "Göteborg Class"
SWE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Göteborg-class consisted of six destroyers built between 1935 and 1942. They had a longer hull and improved machinery compared to their predecessors. They displaced just over 1,020 tons and had a main armament of 120mm/44 K/45 guns, and also six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a limited range but excellent speed."

SWE_destroyer_3:0 "Visby Class"
SWE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The four destroyers of the Visby class were all built between 1942 and 1944. They were similar to the earlier Göteborg class, but were larger, displacing over 1,130 tons. They also had improved engines, somewhat better range, and a strong ASW complement of equipment."

SWE_destroyer_4:0 "Öland Class"
SWE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The two Öland-class destroyers represented a radical change from previous designs. They were launched and completed by the middle of the decade. They were large, displacing 1,880 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 M44 guns in their main armament, and had a strong AA, torpedo, and ASW complement. They were slightly slower than earlier destroyers, but had a significantly improved range."

SWE_light_cruiser_1:0 "Fylgia Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Fylgia was a relatively small armoured cruiser that was commissioned for the Swedish Navy in 1905. The performed mostly training duties during the war, and underwent an extensive refit in 1939-41. Prior to the refit, she displaced over 4,300 tons and was armed with six 152mm/45 K/50 M1903 guns in her main armament. She had good armour, but was relatively slow for a cruiser."

SWE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Gotland Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Gotland class cruiser was an innovative design from the early 1930s that combined the hull of a cruiser with a deck for seaplanes equipped with a catapult for take-off. As the 40s progressed the rapid development in air war made the planes she carried obsolete and she was converted to an air-defence cruiser."

SWE_light_cruiser_3:0 "Gripen Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Following the success of the Gotland cruiser militaristic wings of the Swedish government laid up plans to continue the development of the ship with a light cruiser capable of fulfilling the tasks of destroyers, attacking enemy sea-lanes and providing recon for the navy."

SWE_light_cruiser_4:0 "Tre Kronor Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Tre Kronor class displaced just under 7,700 tons and had decent speed and range. Their main armament consisted of seven 152/53 M42 guns. They had a strong complement of AA guns, torpedoes and ASW equipment as well."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Äran Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The backbone of the Swedish navy is the coastal battleships. More alike heavy cruisers in size they are heavily armed and armoured, giving comparably poor high-seas performance but able to put up a tough fight against any similarly sized ship in their home waters."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Göta Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "With all Swedish coastal battleships having been built before or during the Weltkrieg it is high time to upgrade the navy with new equipment. The Göta class armoured cruiser is intended to fulfil this role, replacing the Äran and Sverige class coastal battleships."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Norrland Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Norrland class is developed as an answer to the increasing requirement of being able to maintain a naval presence outside the littoral zone. Longer and with an improved engine compared to previous ships it would make for a strong backbone of the Swedish Navy."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Svea Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Following the success of the Norrland class heavy cruiser the Svea class improves on the weapon systems of her predecessor. Large enough to brave the open sea but nimble enough to fully take advantage of the Swedish archipelagos the Svea class is uniquely suited to her home."

SWE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Sverige Class"
SWE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before the Weltkrieg. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armoured."

SWE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Skandinavien Class"
SWE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Continued development of the pre-Weltkrieg coastal battleships has led to the Skandinavien class. Larger and equipped with heavier guns it outmatches the old ships in all aspects."

SWE_battleship_1:1 "Kung Gustav II Adolf Class"
SWE_battleship_1_desc:1 "Following the weakening of Russia and the rise of Syndicalism in the west the Swedish threat perception shifted. With large parts of the powerful Royal navy now in the hands of the Union of Britain proposals were made to make new, more powerful ships that could engage the enemy not only in home waters, but out on the North Sea as well."

SWE_battleship_2:1 "Kung Karl XII Class"
SWE_battleship_2_desc:1 "The continued development of our high-seas navy is required to protect ourselves from the outside powers. An independent Sweden must be able to match the powerful navies of the world to maintain our position."

SWE_battleship_3:1 "Drottning Kristina Class"
SWE_battleship_3_desc:1 "While air power is starting to dominate the seas the power of a heavily armed battleship cannot be understated. With new range-finding technology and heavy anti-air armament the battleship can still remain relevant."

SWE_battleship_4:1 "Kung Karl XIV Johan Class"
SWE_battleship_4_desc:1 "With the development of naval air war progresses at a fast pace it is clear that old ships simply cannot keep up with the new weapons and new ships must be built. If Sweden is to have battleships at all, it must be the best."

SWE_SH_battleship_1:1 "Vasa Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Ever since the age of sail the force a country can project at sea has been a measurement of its standing in the world. To fully realise our position, we need to build the largest and most powerful ship to sail the sea."

SWE_SH_battleship_2:1 "Kronan Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "Named after the regal ship that was the largest warship of its time during the 17th century, the Kronan-class battleship is intended to be the final word in the world of heavy battleships."

SWE_carrier_1:1 "Wachtmeister Class"
SWE_carrier_1_desc:1 "Naval theorists predict that naval air power is the future, and while the Gotland class seaplane cruiser is a step in the right direction we need to take it further, designing a ship that is specialised in carrying airplanes. Due to this radical reorganisation, it is only fitting that such ships would carry the names of the greatest organisers of the Swedish Navy through history."

SWE_carrier_2:1 "af Trolle Class"
SWE_carrier_2_desc:1 "While early suggestions of a specialised "hangar-ship" has them being converted from existing keels of capital ships or freighters it is becoming apparent that any fully-fledged navy will need a ship designed keel-up for the role as a carrier."

SWE_carrier_3:1 "Fleming Class"
SWE_carrier_3_desc:1 "As the world is starting to burn around us the destructive power of air superiority is becoming undeniable. It is becoming imperative to stay ahead in being able to wield such a force on the seas if Sweden is ever going to succeed as a blue-water navy."

SWE_carrier_4:1 "Lindman Class"
SWE_carrier_4_desc:1 "Named after the recently deceased admiral and former prime-minister Arvid Lindman this ship would be the pride of Sweden and a force to be reckoned with on any sea."

HOL_submarine_1:0 "K-III Class"
HOL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The K-III class consisted of two submarines built for and used by the Royal Dutch Navy as patrol subs. They were commissioned in the early 1920s, and based on the U.S. Holland-class submarines. Each displaced over 580 tons and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
HOL_submarine_2:0 "O-16 Class"
HOL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The O16 submarine was manufactured and commissioned in the Netherlands for the Royal Dutch Navy in 1936. She was a large submarine, displacing over 980 tons. She had a diving depth of 80m and was armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
HOL_submarine_3:0 "O-21 Class"
HOL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The O21 class is a further development of the predecessing O-16 Class. The subs were slightly larger than the preceding O-class subs, displacing over 990 tons, but are better armed with ten 533mm torpedo tubes."
HOL_submarine_4:0 "Zwaardvis Class"
HOL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The application of electro-engines in Dutch submarines allows for much quieter operation and thus increasing their effectiveness. The "Zwaardvis" (Swordfish) class of submarines are redesigned O-21 class submarines, further enlargend to a displacement of 1,090 tons, were armed with fourteen 533mm torpedo tubes, and had a diving depth of over 100m."

### Destroyers ####
HOL_destroyer_1:0 "Van Ghent Class"
HOL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Van Ghent, or Admiralen, class consisted of eight destroyers built for the Royal Dutch Navy between 1926 and 1931. The ships were based upon early versions of the British A-class. All ships fought in World War II and were either scuttled or sunk. The ships displaced over 1,300 tons, were armed with four 120mm guns, and had decent speed for their vintage."
HOL_destroyer_2:0 "Flores Class"
HOL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Flores Class were gunboats intended for patrol service in the Dutch East Indies. Heavily armed for their size with a main armament consisting of 3 150mm guns and had advanced fire control systems. Their heavy armament made them relatively slow ships, although their intended role mitigated this."
HOL_destroyer_3:0 "Callenburgh Class"
HOL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Gerard Callenburgh class planned for four destroyers for the Royal Dutch Navy. These destroyers displaced over 1,600 tons, were armed with five 120mm guns in their main armament, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes, and had good speed."
HOL_destroyer_4:0 "Piet Hein Class"
HOL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "A further development of the Gerard Callenburgh class, taking their well rounded attributes from their predecesors and refining them further. The ships displaced over 1,800 tons, were armed with four 120mm guns, and had a wide array of ASW armaments as well as on board radar provided by Hazemeyer."

HOL_light_cruiser_1:0 "Java Class"
HOL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch commissioned two Java-class light cruisers in the mid-1920s. The ships were designed in Germany but constructed in the Netherlands. They displaced nearly 6,700 tons and had a main armament of ten 150mm Bofors guns. They were lightly armoured and had decent speed for their vintage."
HOL_light_cruiser_2:0 "De Ruyter Class"
HOL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The light cruiser De Ruyter was built and commissioned in the Netherlands during the mid-1930s. She served primarily in the Dutch East Indies. She displaced over 6,500 tons and was armed with seven 150mm guns in her main armament. She had below-average speed but good range."
HOL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Tromp Class"
HOL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tromp class consists of relatively small light cruisers commissioned for the Netherlands. They displace only 3,350 tons and, as designed, had six 150m guns as their main armament."
HOL_light_cruiser_4:0 "De Zeven Provinciën Class"
HOL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Considerably larger than the predecessing cruiser designs, these ships displace over 12,000 tons and were armed with eight 152mm cannons. They were well-armoured for a light cruiser and had good range."

HOL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Soerabaja Class"
HOL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch cruiser Soerabaja, originally named De Zeven Provinciën, was a coastal defence ship ('panterschip') built and commissioned in the Netherlands prior to World War I."
HOL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Ambon Class"
HOL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Named after the island Ambon, this design of heavy cruisers is proposed to replace the ageing 'Pantserschepen' (coastal defence ships) of the Netherlands. The design is to be heavily armed for its size, continuing the coastal defence ship tradition with 3 240mm guns proposed as main armament. As a consequence, these ships will be slow for a cruiser, but less so than the old Panterschepen."

HOL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The ambitious 'Vlootplan Deckers' of 1913 provided for 9 dreadnoughts for the Royal Dutch Navy, as the arms race between the navies of the world intensified and Japan in particular was seen as a threat to the Dutch colonial possessions in Asia. Funding eventually was provided for four of these dreadnoughts designed partially in Germany. Armed with 8 356mm guns and a further 16 150mm secondaries, these ships displace 26.000 tonnes and are by far the largest Dutch ships built to date."

### USA - USA ###
USA_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
#USA_submarine_1b: "Barracuda Class"
USA_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
USA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."
#USA_submarine_2b: "Salmon Class"
USA_submarine_3:0 "Tambor Class"
USA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of "Fleet Boat" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
#USA_submarine_3b: "Gato Class"
USA_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"
USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 calibre along with numerous subtle design improvements."
USA_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 calibre main guns, a 3"/23 calibre AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was ageing and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
#USA_destroyer_1b: "Farragut Class"
USA_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 calibre guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
#USA_destroyer_2b: "Benson & Gleaves Class"
USA_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
USA_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 calibre guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve manoeuvring during ASW operations."
USA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 calibre guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was ageing but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
USA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximise firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
USA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
USA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
USA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
USA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximise firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armour was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
#USA_heavy_cruiser_1b: "Portland Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Wichita Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 calibre guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
USA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armour from the USS Wichita."
USA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
USA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
USA_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 calibre main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armour."
#USA_battleship_1b: "Pennsylvania Class"
#USA_battleship_1c: "New Mexico Class"
USA_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 calibre guns and have improved armour while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
#USA_battleship_2b: "South Dakota Class"
USA_battleship_3:0 "Iowa Class"
USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armour. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 calibre guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximise AA capabilities."
USA_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
USA_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
#USA_carrier_2b: "Yorktown Class"
#USA_carrier_2c: "Wasp Class"
USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
USA_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armoured deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernise the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 calibre guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armoured than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 calibre guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

#GER_submarine_3b: "Type IXC"
GER_submarine_4:0 "Type XXI"
#GER_submarine_4_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."
GER_destroyer_1:0 "Type 23"
#GER_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Type 23 was a class of torpedo boat built for the Kriegsmarine following World War I. Six vessels were built between 1926 and 1928 and all served during World War II. Despite their torpedo boat designation, the ships were destroyer-sized, displacing over 920 tons and armed with three 105mm L/45 guns."
GER_destroyer_2:0 "Zerstörer 1934"
#GER_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5" guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
GER_destroyer_3:0 "Narvik Class"
#GER_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9") guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
GER_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1944"
#GER_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
GER_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class"
#GER_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9") guns in single turrets."

GER_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class"
#GER_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
GER_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class"
#GER_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
GER_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Blücher Class"
#GER_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
GER_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Hipper Class"
#GER_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8" guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
GER_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Prinz Eugen Class"
#GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
GER_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class Cruiser"
#GER_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
GER_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yorck Class"
#GER_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The three ships of the Yorck-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the British Renown Class. They would have been armed with eight 380mm guns in four twin turrets. All three ships were laid down in 1916, but none were completed due to the war."
GER_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
#GER_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15") guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
GER_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
#GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
GER_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
#GER_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
GER_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
#GER_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
GER_battleship_4:0 "Hindenburg Class"
#GER_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
GER_carrier_1:0 "Flugzeugdampfer I"
#GER_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
GER_carrier_2:0 "Seydlitz Class"
#GER_carrier_2_desc:0 "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
GER_carrier_3:0 "Graf Zeppelin Class"
#GER_carrier_3_desc:0 "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed.
