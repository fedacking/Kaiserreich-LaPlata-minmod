While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tank until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tank of the Second Weltkrieg."

After the war we have made efforts to acquire tanks of our own. So far we only have access to imported, and outdated, tanks. This has to change if we ever wish to be a force to be reckoned with. The m/21 is a step in the right direction as we assembled it domestically even if the parts were imported. Dubbed "Strv m/21", short for Stridsvagn, which means "battle wagon", this is out first attempt at creating an armoured force."

With a new 37mm cannon mounted in a new turret design, we can fight toe-to-toe with the European powers, if not beat them outright. If we are ever to make Germany pay for letting our people be subjects of the Finns, having a 37mm cannon against the 20mm of theirs is definitely a good start."

SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_3_short:0 "IKV 42"
SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Using the reliable Strv m/42 as a platform we can easily make a fine addition to our forces in the form of armoured artillery, providing both direct and indirect fire to support advancing infantry."

SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "PVF 38"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "With a small casemate instead of a turret, we can safely house a proper anti-tank gun within the chassis of a Strv m/38. This vehicle has trouble firing on the move and is best used for supportive or defensive roles."
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Pansarvärnsfordon 40"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short:0 "PVF 40"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "By adding skirt armour, a reinforced frontal glacis plate, and a new high-velocity 75mm Anti-Tank gun that fires APCR rounds we can push our anti-tank capabilities to the limit."
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Pansarvärnsfordon 42"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "PVF 42"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Using the Strv m/42 instead of the m/40 as a starting point allows us to mount an even larger and more powerful gun. By using what we learned from our other designs we can achieve a vehicle that is fast as a medium tank yet packs the same punch as a heavy tank."

SWE_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_short:0 "Lvkv 40"
SWE_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "Using a single 37mm gun instead of twin 20mm guns, this new design is yet another step forward in developing the AA capabilities of our nation."

SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Landsverk Lago"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lago"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "While somewhat outdated, this design is a sturdy and reliable, enough so for us to be able to export it to other warring nations. A comparatively thick frontal plate protects this slow-moving hunk of metal from enemy AT guns of its time, although it's rapidly becoming obsolete in the face of new anti-tank technology."
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Stridsvagn 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Strv 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Strv 100 is a viscious beast of a tank that is as heavy as it is well-armoured. While being somewhat of an industrial nightmare to produce, this tank will ensure that our army has the tools it needs to defend our country."
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Stridsvagn 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Strv 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Strv 101 is a new heavy tank based on the designs of foreign tanks. Thick sloped armour of homogeneous steel protects this hulk of a machine from incoming fire."

SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "Sav 1"
SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sav will be the first of a long line of assault guns. Be swapping out the turret for a casemate we can fit a 105mm Howitzer inside of this comparatively small vehicle."

SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sav 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The large chassis of the Strv 100 allows us to mount a much longer gun in comparison to everything else we've had up until now. Ths Sav 100 represents the next step in the development of self-propelled artillery."

SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_short:0 "Sav 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Strv 101 chassis can, with some tweaks, accustom a 15cm howitzer. The barrel of the gun is about as long as the vehicle itself, which would make a lighter tank incredibly unstable. Fortunately, the sheer weight and size of the Strv 101 makes such an accommodation possible."

SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "IKV 1"
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "Instead of a turret, we can fit a forward-facing anti-tank gun to this armoured vehicle. Similar to the A7V, all of the firepower is projected from the front, making this a great tool to destroy other tanks with."
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Infanterikanonvagn 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short:0 "IKV 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "By removing the turret and adding a superstructure, we can fit a large 105mm anti-tank gun on this already-fearsome machine."

SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "IKV 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Instead of adding a casemate, we can lower the gun into the body of the tank itself. This gives the vehicle a very low profile from which to unleash accurate long-ranged anti-tank fire."

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1:0 "Luftvärnskanonvagn 1"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "Lvkv 1"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Instead of a normal gun we can mount our powerful 40mm anti-air cannon on this tank, giving us mobile anti-air capabilities."

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_2_short:0 "Lvkv 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Strv 100 is significantly larger and heavier than the Lago, and provides for a much better platform from which to fire our famed 40mm gun."

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3_short:0 "Lvkv 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "While a platform for the 7.5cm gun is something we have long sought after, it has remained implausible to conceive of such a vehicle. That is, until we started producing the Strv 101. This vehicle will provide a level of anti-air none of our adversaries will expect us to have."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Stridsvagn m/44 Gustav Adolf"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Gustav Adolf"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "A tribute to the Swedish king who ordered the Vasa ship, the largest at its time, to be built. This landship, which is exactly that, is meant to give our country a weapon like none other. This monstrous behemoth will bow down any opposition to our might with its twin 105mm guns."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Supersvårt Stormartilleri"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "SSSA"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Weighing 200 tons, this armored beast is a large platform for the 283mm naval gun that is usually only fitted on ships. This impressive arrangement can deliver fire with a accurate range of over 20km."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Supersvår Kanonvagn"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "SSKV"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Gustav Adolf chassis is capable of hosting our 283mm naval gun... in a pair. This crime against humanity is to be dubbed "Supersvår Kanonvagn" (Super-Heavy Artillery Wagon) and provides our ground forces with unmatched fire support."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "SSLVKV"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Super-heavy anti-air is so far only a hypothetical concept, but with the advent of high flying quad-engined bombers and the invention of the jet engine this concept may just as well become a reality if we are to survive on the modern battlefield. An arrangement of a twin 128mm AA gun firing HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) shells at enemy aircraft, the "Supersvår Luftvärnskanonvagn" (Super-Heavy Anti-Aircraft Gun Wagon) is the worst nightmare of any bomber pilot."

SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Stridsvagn 103"
SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Strv 103"
SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The pinnacle of all of our previous developments, this tank has everything we could ever desire of an armored fighting vehicle. The only thing more modern than this would be a tank with optical camouflage and a railgun, but until that happens this tank will be enough for the next 50 years."

SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Självgående Artillerivagn 103 Blixtnedslag"
SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "Blixtnedslag"
SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Blixtnedslag, meaning Lightning Strike, is exactly that. With a comparatively low profile, this self-propelled gun can set up and fire from forest glades and other concealed areas. Using computerised fire-control, this modern weapon of war gives us a foot into the next Weltkrieg, should such a horrific event ever occur."

SWE_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Infanterikanonvagn 103 Varulven"
SWE_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "Varulven"
SWE_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "Varulven means "The Werewolf" and this name is not chosen by accident. This low-profile tank-destroyer stalks its prey while being well concealed in the Swedish forests, before unleashing destruction with its 122mm anti-tank gun."

SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1:0 "Luftvärnskanonvagn 103 Hagelskur"
SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "Hagelskur"
SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Modern jet aircraft are simply too fast to be shot down with a single blow from a comparatively low-velocity cannon. Instead we can rely on sheer numbers. Hagelskur, meaning Hail Shower, is designed to output a volume of fire that is as high as possible. Octuple 20mm AA-cannons in a gatling-configuration, each packing AP-I shells, should be more than enough to light up the sky."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after the revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse, who died in the Easter Rising of 1916. The Pearse I was the first real Irish attempt at producing their own line of armour, and owed much to the German WK1 tanks delivered to them during peace time."
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Wolfe ILA-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Wolfe L-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Wolfe light tank was designed in 1936 as a considerable upgrade to the previous Pearse tank built in '34. Named after the father of Irish republicanism, Wolfe Tone, the Wolfe was a quick and nimble tank that packed a punch despite it's size."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Emmet ILA-41"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Emmet L-41"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Produced in 1941, the Emmet light tank was the final Irish effort to produce a modern light tank for use in WK2. Faster than the prior two iterations and better armoured, it lacked the punching power of the heavier Collins or Savage models, but made up for it by being cheaper to produce and more flexible."
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "O'Connell IMA-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "O'Connell M-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The O'Connell IMA-39 was the first in a new series of medium tank designs created by the Irish Republican Army. Much more heavily armoured than the lighter designs and with more firepower, the IMA-39 was still a highly mobile tank. Irish tanks were renown for being highly cost-effective, and the O'Connell continued this trend."

IRE_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Collins IMA-41"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Collins M-41"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Collins IMA-41 was a sturdy and effective medium tank design created by the Irish Republican Army to serve as a front line battle tank in WK2. Named after Irish hero (and President of Ireland at the time) Michael Collins, the tank served effectively in the European theatre of the war."
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Clarke IMA-43"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Clarke M-43"

IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Affectionately nicknamed a 'big clunky bastard' by General Richard Mulcahy, the 1934 produced heavy tank Fionn was Ireland's first real foray into the post-GW heavy tank era. As it's nickname suggested, it had woeful reliability scores, but it did later prove to have some use during WK2."
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Savage IHA-41"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Savage H-41"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The aptly named Savage was one of the most advanced tank designs produced and tested by Ireland during WK2. Few were made due to their prohibitive industrial cost, but the Savage packed a ferocious punch and was known for it's high reliability despite being a heavy tank design."

IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Cormac IHA-43"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Cormac H-43"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Ireland's final pre-modern iteration of the heavy battle tank, the Cormac offered superior protection and firepower to the Savage but struggled to hold it's own weight, and regularly encountered engine problems. Very few were built, and they were viewed as 'smouldering death traps' more often than not by Irish tankers."

IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Lugh ISHA-43"
IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lugh SH-43"
IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after a legendary Irish hero, the Lugh was a new generation of super-heavy battle tank theorised towards the end of WK2. Only a few models ever saw production due to the massive cost it took to produce them, but it is unlikely that the Cormac would ever have seen widespread use in battle even if it had come earlier in the war. Like many super-heavy tanks, it was simply too unreliable."

gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Tanks in the Weltkrieg were developed separately and simultaneously by the United Kingdom and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front. The British prefer to call them "tanks", a name adopted during the early stages of their development as a security measure to conceal their purpose, while the German counterpart, "Panzer", stuck in many German-influenced nations. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armoured only enough to stop small arms fire."
