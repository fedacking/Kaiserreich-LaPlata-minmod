POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of Baikal cossacks, Semyonov and his boys have managed to established a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight bolsheviks in Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon puppeted by Japan. When Kolchak 1925 coup has failed and rogue admiral left Russia, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. One way or another, but the 'father-of-state' managed to return in big politics. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosperious and he is not willing to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC:0 "An old general Mitsue was used to leading a Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honorable war hero, he has been granted an ultimate gift from the emperor: to peacefully rule the lands he conquered many years ago. An old man is an isolationist and will never wage any war by himself. With him into position, the dream of Greater Transamur has died."
