libya.1.t:0 "Vilayet of Tripolitania"
libya.1.d:0 "When Italy surrendered to the Central Powers in 1919, the Ottomans regained Libya as part of their Empire. However, despite the final victory in the war, the Weltkrieg showed the weakness and the decline of the Ottoman Empire. During the 1920s, with the decline of the Ottoman authority over the Empire and mounting internal pressure, Libya and Armenia were able to gain the position of autonomous region on June 1928. Since then, Libya remained loyal to its master in Constantinople, but lately the Arab population is again starting to show signs of distress and Egypt in the east might be waiting for the right occasion to free Libya from Ottoman rule... or to become its new master!"
libya.1.a:0 "What will the future bring?"

libya.2.t:0 "Status of Tripolitania"
libya.2.d:0 "For many years, the Ottomans have been free to impose their will over us. Today, problems have arisen for the Ottomans, and Idris-al-Sanusi wishes to claim the Libyan throne once and for all and establish a Free Libya."
libya.2.a:0 "Declare complete independence from the Ottomans!"
libya.2.b:0 "Time is not right!"

libya.3.t:0 "Tripolitania declares independence"
libya.3.d:0 "For many years, we have ruled over Tripolitania. But today, with our country engaged in a lengthy conflict, Tripolitania decided to use this opportunity to break from our dominance. How should we react to this mess?"
libya.3.a:0 "Blasphemy! Crush this upstart!"
libya.3.b:0 "Let them go"

libya.4.t:0 "Libya still exists!"
libya.4.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces could not break apart the rebellious state of Libya. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arabian states of Hashemite Arabia and Egypt. Shall we recognise the independence of Libya?"
libya.4.a:0 "Accept their independence..."
libya.4.b:0 "Never!"

libya.5.t:0 "Foreign policy"
libya.5.d:0 "In order to secure our independence from foreign threats we should join the already existing Arabian alliance between Egypt and Hashemite Arabia."
libya.5.a:0 "Send proposition"
libya.5.b:0 "There is no need for an alliance"

libya.6.t:0 "Libya wants to join our alliance"
libya.6.d:0 "Libya is seeking allies in order to protect its independence from foreign threats. Do we want to admit Libya into our alliance?"
libya.6.a:0 "Yes, Arabian countries should keep together"
libya.6.b:0 "Refuse them!"

libya.7.t:0 "Libya joins the Arabian block"
libya.7.d:0 "Egypt accepted our request and admitted us to their alliance. With our presence in this alliance our independence should be secured!"
libya.7.a:0 "Great!"
