The Militia of Molokai, a pro-Hawaiian sovereignty group took up arms last week and rallied the natives to their cause. The last military base was taken today, and we have lost control of the island and possibly of all of our Pacific holdings."
hawaii.1.a:0 "We should have expected this..."
hawaii.1.b:0 "We should have expected this... (Play Hawaii)"

hawaii.4.a:0 "Damn"
hawaii.9.t:0 "Hawaii Requests Entry into the Entente"

hawaii.14.d:0 "The CSA's extensive network of spies had led to their learning of the labour issues that were cropping up on the islands in Hawaii. The islands were not part of the CSA's overall strategy but the plight of the workers was in the best interest of the CSA and if it happened to ensure the Hawaii islands came under the control of the CSA then so be it."

hawaii.16.b:0 "Let their revolution evolve"
hawaii.17.t:0 "Pineapple Union of Hawai'i"
hawaii.17.d:0 "Since the reforms on the island the trade unionists have been gaining more and more power.

The reforms that were proposed would make the islands a virtual puppet of the CSA and are seen by some as just one step to annexation by the CSA. While many were resistant to both ideas, many more saw that they had little choice in the matter"

hawaii.19.t:0 "Hawaii Refuses CSA Help"
hawaii.19.d:0 "The islands of Hawaii have refused to allow the CSA to mediate the labour issues on the island.

hawaii.24.t:0 "Dealing Syndicalist Hawai'i"

hawaii.25.a:0 "Peace and Order has been restored to the island"
hawaii.26.t:0 "They Refuse!"
hawaii.26.d:0 "The foolish Hawaiians have refused to get rid of their syndicalist government. The military largely agrees that military action must be taken to restore law and order to the island while other political officials suggest that it isn't that much of a threat."

hawaii.27.a:0 "Aloha Hawaii!"

hawaii.28.t:0 "The Future of Hawai'i?"
hawaii.28.d:0 "We are now cut off from America and for the first time in decades independent again. We must decide our fate. Some are clamouring for a return to the Monarchy of Hawai'i that was overthrown by the Americans in 1893. However others are claiming that the age of monarchy is dead and we should set up a republic inspired by the Americans.
