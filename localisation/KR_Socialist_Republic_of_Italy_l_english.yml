### Focuses
SRI_fourth_congress:0 "Begin the Fourth Congress"
SRI_fourth_congress_desc:0 "The Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union is due to begin, where the policies of the nation will be debated and where the Social-Reformists, the Anarcho-Syndicalists, and the National Syndicalists will vie for control over the Republic."
SRI_social_reform:0 "Social-Reformists"
SRI_social_reform_desc:0 "The Social-Reforminsts under Filippo Turati have taken power, pushing the nation onto a more moderate path."
SRI_agriculture_act:0 "Italian Agriculture Act"
SRI_agriculture_act_desc:0 "A central promise of the Social-Reformists is to reform southern farmlands, improving their overall yield and giving the economy a much-needed jolt. It's also expected the move will result in a large migration of people to the capital as farms stop relying primarily on heavy labour."
SRI_social_programs:0 "Fund Social Programs"
SRI_social_programs_desc:0 "The Social-Reformist approach to dealing with widespread corruption and crime in the Republic is to increase funding to education and social programs. It's a slow way to address the issue, perhaps, but in the long run they are determined that bettering the lot of the poorest Italians will have the greatest impact."
SRI_focus_defence:0 "Focus on Defence"
SRI_focus_defence_desc:0 "The Republic should not be a nation focused on offence, but rather on defence and peaceful reform. If reunion comes with the north, it will not be best served if it comes at the hands of those seen as brutal conquerors."
SRI_anarco_synd:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalists"
SRI_anarco_synd_desc:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalists under Palmiro Togliatti have maintained their hold on power after the Congress, keeping the nation on a steady path towards true syndicalism."
SRI_industry_act:0 "Italian Industrial Act"
SRI_industry_act_desc:0 "Industry in the Republic can, at best, be described as anaemic. Laws must be passed to reform the burden on corporations and give the trade unions better ability to aid the companies they work for rather than to hamper them. We must all work together for a brighter future!"
SRI_republican_guard:0 "Fund the Republican Guard"
SRI_republican_guard_desc:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalists understand that corruption and crime are rife throughout the Republic. The most efficient way to deal with this is to increase funding to the Republican Guard, and to pass laws that clear the way for them to better enforce order throughout the country."
SRI_popular_army:0 "A Popular Army"
SRI_popular_army_desc:0 "The best way to push forward is to ensure the republic's army is both efficient and well-trained. Quality is better than quantity, but faster training will also ensure more soldiers are available in the future."
SRI_national_synd:0 "National Syndicalists"
SRI_national_synd_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists under Benito Mussolini have taken power, pushing the nation onto a more extremist and militaristic path."
SRI_heavy_industry_act:0 "Fund Heavy Industry"
SRI_heavy_industry_act_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists believe in improving the economy through sheer brute force - directly funding the expansion of heavy industry throughout the Republic, with an equal focus on military infrastructure as well as consumer goods."
SRI_secret_police:0 "Expand the Secret Police"
SRI_secret_police_desc:0 "War with the crime families is fully expected, and the best way to combat them is to know what they'll do before they do. This means the establishment of a large and efficient secret police to keep tabs on not only the people but also the Republican Guard which has been plagued with corruption of its own."
SRI_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare For War"
SRI_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "The call must go out to the people of the Republic - prepare for war with the north, and indeed all of the Republic's enemies. Unity and greatness will only be achieved through blood, but it will all be for the righteous cause of restoring Italian honour."
SRI_center_on_sicily:0 "Centre on Sicily"
SRI_center_on_sicily_desc:0 "Sicily is the true heart of the Republic, and in a way its greatest weakness due to its vulnerable coastline. Its ports must be fortified and the island prepared to be the last line of defence should the war ever turn against the Republic. We will hold out on the island, if it truly comes to that."
SRI_center_on_capital:0 "Centre on Naples"
SRI_center_on_capital_desc:0 "The capital city of Naples is our greatest jewel, and since it is so close to the border we must take extra precaution to fortify it from attacks by both land and sea."
SRI_no_center:0 "Fortify the Border"
SRI_no_center_desc:0 "There is no true centre of the Republic's defence, and we must focus on ensuring the northern papists never cross the border into the south. That is our only realistic path to success."
SRI_destabilize_north:0 "Destabilise the North"
SRI_destabilize_north_desc:0 "There are socialists and syndicalist supporters who quietly remain in the Federation. We must reach out to them and fund their efforts, and in doing so hamper the north's ability to defend itself when the time comes for us to strike."
SRI_suppress_catholics:0 "Suppress Catholics"
SRI_suppress_catholics_desc:0 "The one true issue we face is that we are a nation of faithful Catholics who may question their true loyalties when it comes time to opposing the papacy. Most realize the north has been comprised by its political aims, true, but we must seek out any of those who could turn against us when the time comes to act."

SRI_attack_north:0 "Initiate Risorgimento"
SRI_attack_north_desc:0 "The rival papists of the north are exposed and weak! Now is the time to strike them down and unite Italy!"
SRI_peaceful_reunion:0 "Propose Peaceful Reunion"
SRI_peaceful_reunion_desc:0 "Our differences with the northern government are stark and unlikely to be resolved peacefully. If that situation were to ever change, however, reaching a peaceful compromise might be possible..."
SRI_incorporate_north:0 "Incorporate the North"
SRI_incorporate_north_desc:0 "Italy has been reunited under a single government, from the Alps all the way to Sicily in the south. While this is a time to rejoice, there is much work still to be done to organise those accustomed to living under tyranny."
SRI_irridentism:0 "Irredentist Path"

SRI_claim_tunisia:0 "Claim Tunisia"
SRI_claim_tunisia_desc:0 "Tunisia has a significant Italian minority living in it. We should try to unite it with Italy."
SRI_claim_malta:0 "Claim Malta"

SRI_claim_libya:0 "Claim Libya"
SRI_claim_libya_desc:0 "The Libyan coast was lost to us after the Great war. Today, however, this land is ripe for the taking."

SRI_entreat_mafia:0 "Truce with the Crime Families"
SRI_entreat_mafia_desc:0 "While it might be unthinkable to some, we must entreat with the organised crime families - secretly, if need be - and call a truce in order to give us some breathing room to grow. We will deal with them in time, but for now we simply need peace."
SRI_war_with_mafia:0 "War on the Crime Families"

### Events ###

socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "At the end of the Weltkrieg, Italy was in disarray. It collapsed into chaos, with the victorious Central Powers diving up the once proud nation. While the northern half of Italy would become occupied by the Austrian Empire, the southern half would become the reformed Kingdom of Two Sicilies, with an Austrian puppet upon the throne. This decision was vastly unpopular amongst the south Italian peasantry, leading to a series of peasant revolts and uprisings. Soon, Anarcho-Syndicalist thinkers fleeing from the Austrian occupation in the north arrived in Naples and began to build support for a revolution. In February 1921, Palmiro Togliatti and Amadeo Bordiga led a revolution. The Austrians were unable to halt the Syndicalist tide, and after two months of civil war the Syndicalists triumphed and the Socialist Republic of Italy was declared. \n\n Unfortunately, the Republic's troubles had merely just begun. Power struggles and purges ensued, and southern Italy was still in shambles from both the civil war and the Weltkrieg. Now, 15 years since the Republic's founding, the nation is only just barely starting to rebuild and industrialise. Hampered by the Italian Federation to the North and the insidious organised crime families that has grown over the past few years within their own borders, the nation is beset by challenges and dangers on all sides."
socitaly.1.a:0 "Forward!"

socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Anarcho-Syndicalists seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Social-Reformists desire a government that helps the people, with an expansion of social programs. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the National-Syndicalists, advances the new ideology of Totalism, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Social-Reformists advocate for moderate industrialisation, whilst also expanding Italy's agriculture. The Anarcho-Syndicalists argue for industrialisation, and Mussolini's National-Syndicalists demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a:0 "We must expand both our industry and our agriculture"
socitaly.3.b:0 "We should focus on industrialisation"
socitaly.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "While discussing internal security, the organised crime problem emerged as the dominant topic of debate. The factions of the party are staunchly divided on how to approach the issue. The Social-Reformists wish to increase social spending to help the population in affected areas in hopes of reducing crime family authority, whilst the Anarcho-Syndicalists wish to empower the Republican Guard to fight off the criminals. The National-Syndicalists take things a step further, arguing for expansive secret police services and surveillance in order to bring this threat -- and any other -- to a swift end."
socitaly.4.a:0 "Focus on social spending and helping the people!"
socitaly.4.b:0 "Increase funding and empower the Republican Guard!"
socitaly.4.c:0 "Utilise every tool available to smash the crime family threat"

socitaly.5.t:0 "Day 3: Military Policy"
socitaly.5.d:0 "The final order of business is the matter of the Republic's military. The Social-Reformists propose a small, professional army for self-defence purposes, while the Anarcho-Syndicalists push for a large people's army in preparation for the war with North Italy. Mussolini's National-Syndicalists' proposal is the most radical yet: extreme demographic controls in an effort to increase the population for future manpower."
socitaly.5.a:0 "A small, professional army for self defence!"

socitaly.10.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous National-Syndicalists from achieving any kind of power, the Anarcho-Syndicalists and Social-Reformists have agreed to form a coalition government.

socitaly.11.t:0 "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.11.d:0 "During the recent Congress of the Greater Italian Union, none of the three factions achieved a clear majority.

Aiming to create as much havoc as they can in the name of the oppressed Catholic Church, the NeoSanfedisti could tie up much of our resources if their actions continue."

socitaly.24.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
socitaly.24.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This is a serious blow to the Catholic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
socitaly.24.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [SRI.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other Catholic agitators get similar ideas in the future."

socitaly.24.b:0 "Finally!"

socitaly.25.t:0 "Suppression of Catholics"
socitaly.25.d:0 "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in [SRI.GetNameDef] and [ITA.GetNameDef], but should any trouble arise the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it's dealt with far more readily than it might be otherwise."
socitaly.25.a:0 "It must be done, for the greater good"

socitaly.26.t:0 "Southern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.26.d:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of syndicalism, the [SRI.GetAdjective] government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful - anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to [ITA.GetNameDef] - and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the north, and renewed calls for war."
socitaly.26.a:0 "These people are innocent of all but faith!"

socitaly.30.t:0 "A Proposal from the South"
socitaly.30.d:0 "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have approached us and raised the possibility of a peaceful union, one where we would come under the rule of their government as a single Italy.

socitaly.32.t:0 "The North Rejected our Proposal"
socitaly.32.d:0 "The stupid politicians in [From.GetNameDef] have refused to accept our proposal, determined to keep Italy split in two. Already there are people in the street demanding that we do something to put an end to this foolishness."
socitaly.32.a:0 "Let's not be rash..."
socitaly.32.b:0 "They are absolutely right!"

socitaly.33.t:0 "The North is no more"
socitaly.33.d:0 "While our northern enemies are gone, we still have not reunified Italy. Even so, it does mean that the lingering question of our divided nation has been put to rest."

socitaly.35.a:0 "Roma is once again the capital!"
socitaly.35.b:0 "Napoli should remain the capital"

socitaly.40.t:0 "Making Peace with Organised Crime"
socitaly.40.d:0 "While the government can't openly admit to colluding with the country's organised crime families, it can communicate with them through back-channels...and has now done so to initiate a kind of truce in order to give the nation breathing room to get its economy back on track. The crime families have agreed to reduce their operations in key areas, and in return the Republican Guard will tacitly leave them be. There are those who fear this will, however, only make the crime families better able to corrupt officials who might see them now as unofficial allies rather than enemies of the state."
socitaly.40.a:0 "It give us time, and that's what's important"
socitaly.41.t:0 "War on Organised Crime!"
socitaly.41.d:0 "Today the Republican Guard has been given its marching orders: it's to be war on organised crime in [SRI.GetNameDef], no matter where it's to be found. The crime families will inevitably be taken down, though there's certain to be backlash in the meantime, and more than one government official is quietly holing up and expecting the worst in the days to come."
socitaly.41.a:0 "They cannot be allowed to hold us back!"
socitaly.42.t:0 "Corruption Scandal!"
socitaly.42.d:0 "Newspapers throughout [SRI.GetNameDef] are rife with news of a prominent member of the government being in the pocket of organised crime families. Protests have broken out in the streets, and it is expected to be several weeks yet before the scandal dies down enough for the government to continue with business as usual."
socitaly.42.a:0 "Not good"
socitaly.43.t:0 "Racketeering Scandal"
socitaly.43.d:0 "Despite promises by the organised crime families to keep a hands-off approach to the government's business, it was revealed that several of the government's new industrial contracts have been suffering from a racketeering scam perpetrated by organised crime, and which is funnelling plenty of government money directly into the crime families' pockets. Republican Guard officials have promised to step up quiet attempts to bring the families in line."
socitaly.43.a:0 "They had better! This cannot continue!"
socitaly.44.t:0 "Government Official Assassinated!"
socitaly.44.d:0 "An important member of the cabinet turned up dead today, shot in his vehicle on the side of the road in a style that could easily be attributed to one of several prominent organised crime families. The Republican Guard is investigating, but so far leads indicate the official had been in the pocket of one of the families until they attempted to end the relationship. Investigators are promising to step up efforts to shut down further attempts by the crime families to infiltrate the government's ranks."
socitaly.44.a:0 "Another murder?!"
socitaly.45.t:0 "Bombing in [bombing_state.GetName]"
socitaly.45.d:0 "In yet another reprisal by one of the organised crime families in the ongoing war against their influence, a bomb was set off in [bombing_state.GetName] today, killing several Republican Guard members and severely damaging an important state factory."
socitaly.45.a:0 "This war had better be over soon!"
socitaly.46.t:0 "Massive Strikes"
socitaly.46.d:0 "Massive strikes were held by workers across the country today, in protest for the casualties suffered in the ongoing war between organised crime families and the Republican Guard. Too many lives have been lost in the crossfire, stike leaders say, and the government isn't doing enough to stop the violence. The strikes are expected to go on for several weeks more before the rage settles."
socitaly.46.a:0 "They're not wrong"
socitaly.47.t:0 "Crime Family Leader Arrested"
socitaly.47.d:0 "The head of one of the most prominent organised crime families was arrested today, brought up on charges that ranged from racketeering to murder. It's part of an ongoing investigation by the Republican Guard, and while further reprisals might be expected from the other crime families it's considered a definite blow by the government in finally reigning in the power of these syndicates."
socitaly.47.a:0 "Finally some good news!"

socitaly.50.t:0 "Revolution"
socitaly.50.d:0 "The internal dissent has grown too far, the people are revolting against our government, asking for democracy and free elections! What should we do? Should we suffocate the revolution with their blood or should we listen to their demands?"
