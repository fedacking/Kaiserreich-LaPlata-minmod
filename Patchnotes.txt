* We have decided to go against our usual policy, and ship the incomplete Japanese rework rather than waiting for it to be finished. Japan has been unmaintained for several months now, and thus we believe that however buggy the unfinished rework is, it can only be better than the live version. The rest of the rework, foreign policy in particular, will be in 0.5, until then bug reports are even more appreciated than normal.

### Incomplete Content ###
We thought you couldn't wait any longer for 0.3...
The following trees sadly couldn't be finished in time, so have had their groundwork added, and will be finished and activated at a later date:
Ethiopia
Ireland
Legation Cities
USA and associated revolters
Qing and Republic of China decisions have been moved to a WIP focus tree, full focus trees coming later
The rework of the German focus tree isn't done, and again, will be added at a later date, but some minor changes have been added in the meantime
Siamese custom technological GFX were causing too many errors and couldn't get fixed in time so has been removed, will be redone and added back again later
A few changes from HOI4 1.3.3 couldn't be ported across in time (Russian infrastructure changes for example), will be added later
A few minor bugs haven't been fixed, but they are all just typos, cosmetic or missing GFX...with the exception of:
Puppets are still not peacing out correctly, we have been trying really hard to fix this one, but aren't 100% sure we have been successful, so any saves with this bug would be priceless

### Fixes ###
Note this isn't a complete list, it is really hard to record every single bug we fix. That being said most should be here, but don't lose heart if a bug you reported isn't listed here. Also sorry if this list is a bit of a mess, it has been copied straight from our bugtracker with very little clean up.
